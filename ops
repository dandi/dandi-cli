Although with caching we at least would not bother redoing it twice if did recently, it would be nice if we have a way to report back to the user on the progress of digesting.  For upload we have a dedicated column `upload` which shows `%`.  But I wonder if we better have a dedicated column \"progress\" which would be populated (and either cleared or report time on how long it took after it is done) used by whatever 'status' column reports (digesting, or uploading, etc).","files":null}]}
