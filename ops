These files are invisible and can normally be safely ignored, but they break the upload command. These files are difficult for mac users to identify, as they are hidden in Finder, and only findable with `ls -a` on the command line. I think it would be better to ignore them on upload. If not, then maybe we could throw an error right away, instead of waiting for all of the meta-data to be gathered (for 18 minutes in this case) before throwing the error.\n\n```bash\n(base) Bens-MacBook-Pro-2:dandi_staging bendichter$ dandi organize -d 000008 /Volumes/easystore5T/data/Tolias/nwb -f symlink\n2020-03-17 14:43:47,494 [    INFO] Loading metadata from 1319 files\n[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Using backend LokyBackend with 8 concurrent workers.\n[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done   2 tasks      | elapsed:    9.1s\n[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done   9 tasks      | elapsed:   10.4s\n...\n[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 1285 tasks      | elapsed: 18.1min\n[Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 1319 out of 1319 | elapsed: 18.6min finished\n2020-03-17 15:02:25,252 [ WARNING] Completely empty record for /Volumes/easystore5T/data/Tolias/nwb/._20171204_sample_2.nwb\nError: 1 out of 1319 files were found not containing all necessary metadata: /Volumes/easystore5T/data/Tolias/nwb/._20171204_sample_2.nwb\n```","files":null}]}
