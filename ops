Which one of more interest for you here @bendichter ?\n\nWe could also have both DANDI and BIDS dandisets. In BIDS there could be a case where subject_id is also present in `participants.tsv` and have no `sub-` folder. Anyways for BIDS -- worth looking into integrating/reusing other BIDS-oriented frameworks (pybids etc). With DANDI layouts - also see if/how we could avoid reinventing the wheel.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f068089e26f6e2e30d51a62e75a77af7d9dc5ecb"},"timestamp":1724684289,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6JtkML","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1457#issuecomment-2310423307"},"message":"I was thinking more for remote dandisets but I suppose either could be useful.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1724687024,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6Jt681","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1457#issuecomment-2310516533"},"message":"indeed.  Let's aim to implement `get_subject_ids` for both, which would be based on pretty much what we already have in https://github.com/dandi/dandi-schema/blob/HEAD/dandischema/metadata.py#L392 but there we go through all the assets, and here we would want to avoid that and just list folders `sub-` folders at the top level (remote or local), sanitize labels, and return them (likely sorted for consistency).","files":null}]}
