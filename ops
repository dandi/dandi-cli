I haven't uploaded to DANDI in a while, so upgraded the DANDI Client (`pip install dandi --upgrade`) to 0.62.4.\n2. Ran `dandi -l debug upload -i dandi-staging https://gui-staging.dandiarchive.org/dandiset/215229/draft`, which returned the following error:\n    ```\n    Error: Server requires schema version 0.6.8; client only supports 0.6.6.  You may need to upgrade dandi and/or dandischema.\n    ```\n3. The installed `dandischema` version was `0.10.0`.  When I upgraded `dandischema` to `0.10.2`, I no longer received the schema mismatch error.\n\n## Possible solution\n\n1. Could we start to pin the `dandischema` version more strictly in the DANDI Client's requirements so that this mismatch is avoided?  Currently it is set to a range (i.e. `dandischema \u003e= 0.9.0, \u003c 0.11`).\n\nThank you.","files":null}]}
