With something like `--disappeared` we could detect which paths were no longer considered and offer to remove them.\n\nAlternatively - we could make a default mode to be \"complete\" (default) which would imply removing files which were not \"re-organized\" (probably should ask first since could lead to the loss of data) and only by adding explicit `--mode=incremental` (complete - default) new file added in, while allowing all previous stick around.","files":null}]}
