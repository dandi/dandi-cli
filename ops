However, I ended up not using it because there is no need at this point. The points in the code used to need this have a corrected origin of `ORIGIN_VALIDATION_DANDI_ZARR`, such as https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/88c327512b01ab134fb1f4bb00c1d09219e3b34a/dandi/files/zarr.py#L276. I was keeping to function for future use.\n\nHowever, upon working on #1609, I discovered that `get_zarr_format_version` is not able to handle the final or experimental Zarr V3 Specification correctly. I can either remove the function entirely or add the handling of Zarr V3 Specification at this point. For support for deciding Zarr V1 Specification, will be  a bit tricky. I think will need to try much older version of Zarr to see what the file formats are like.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1744650230,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6nCFsz","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1610#issuecomment-2802342707"},"message":"before we jump to v3, for which we could add a test if there is `zarr.json` and get `zarr_format` from it, it doesn't work even for v2 of zarr like those we already have in the archive , e.g.\nhttps://dandiarchive.s3.amazonaws.com/zarr/001e3b6d-26fb-463f-af28-520a25680ab4/.zmetadata?versionId=lFCKAw3nHHT66S14.hEaGXm9sBL9eYvW where it says `\"zarr_format\": 2`?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1744650358,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6nCHIp","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1610#issuecomment-2802348585"},"message":"anyways -- we should strive to provide that `standard_version` for Zarr \"files\".
