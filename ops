Need to \n- analyze what tests/fixtures we spend most time on?\n- analyze and implement what could be speed up to speed up testing?\n\nthere was effort/attempt to parallelize testing (#194) which IIRC encountered a \"show stopper\" at that point, may be worth resurrecting since most of the tests are probably bottlenecking in IO and parallelization should have positive effect.","files":null}]}
