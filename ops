Since they are mutable ATM, asset ids are changing upon metadata change and not stored locally, there is no sense of identity of a zarr folder.  That forbids any efficient renaming of a zarr archive locally. \n\nWith `dandi move`, similar one to `dandi delete` we have [*], we could rename locally and on the server really fast, thus making subsequent `dandi upload` if so needed update an existing zarr archive instead of uploading a new one and deleting an old one. \n\nExtra points to keep in mind\n- IIRC `dandi organize` can operate in-place (within existing dandiset).  Then in such scenario \"by default\" it should use `dandi move` internally to move files. But it should be some kind of a switch which would do server side change as well or not.\n- Originally I thought to file it as `dandi mv` but decided to name it `dandi move` instead -- https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1005","files":null}]}
