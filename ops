RTD allows for [custom domains](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/custom-domains.html) but we will need to investigate further if we can use a custom domain that also includes a path (e.g. `/api/client`).  \n\nIf we agree on this being the solution, I would be happy to work on this.  I will just need the credentials for the `dandi` RTD account.","files":null}]}
