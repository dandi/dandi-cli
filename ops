Happens even if I roll back to e.g. `tags/0.5.0~1` . In the log I see\n```\n2020-08-12 14:58:33,706 [    INFO] Loading metadata from 31 files\n2020-08-12 14:58:42,151 [   DEBUG] Calling memoized version of \u003cfunction get_metadata at 0x7fee9fdd5430\u003e for /home/yoh/.tmp/tmp9onmwll2/v2.0.1/test_ClusterWaveforms.nwb\n```\nso it is doing smth for 9 seconds, although then says that it does reuse cached `get_metadata` from the previous test in the matrix... so the question is what is it doing and either it could be avoided.","files":null}]}
