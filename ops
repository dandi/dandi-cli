Also, it felt that having separate/dedicated versioning of core functionality could be helpful instead of trying to figure out when `dandi-api` should progress dependency on dandi-cli, where it might just be changing the CLI etc.\n\nBut for now, unless @dchiquito would object, we could just keep it here and  `dandi-api` would need to add `dandi` into dependencies of dandi-api.\n\nWe might need though to adjust our logging setup in https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/master/dandi/__init__.py#L43 to not interfere with global logging configuration (filed https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/466)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"818a29386a430d42cbb57ad6dcccbe0fb486ffc3"},"timestamp":1615569275,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NzYzMjE0OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/464#issuecomment-797632149"},"message":"I think for now adding `dandi` as a dependency of `dandi-api` would be fine.
