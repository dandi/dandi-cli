I like decorators, so there could even be `@map_dandi_instance` which would convert string kwarg value into a tuple and pass into underlying function.   I would leave it to you to decide if decorator is worth it (affects the stack possibly making harder to debug etc).","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1596832921,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzYzNDcwMjUxNw=="},"status":2}]}
