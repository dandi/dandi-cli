Also the notion of a `Version` is present within perspective Python client/API redesign: https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/447/files#diff-ca726fb8fbfbf61284ae89742c7c5621e5d4305fc9fd8a83047f71eb07a28379R89 which ATM mimics it more from dandi-api returned structure.\n\nI feel that if we are to have `version` within metadata, we should also encapsulate other related to that publishing process metadata (date of publishing, and optionally description). I wonder where should it \"fit\" in the metadata record for a published dandiset?  I guess it could be added to `wasGeneratedBy`.  \n\nBut ATM we override it to be of type `Optional[List[Project]]` from the original (in `CommonModel`) \"wider\" `Optional[List[Activity]]`. Should we then make it `Optional[List[Union[Project,Activity]]` (although Project is subclass of Activity, I guess it would be useful to direct web UI?)","files":null}]}
