We do similar already in https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/blob/master/.github/workflows/template/build-%7B%7Bostype%7D%7D.yaml.j2#L443 so recipe could be adopted here.\n\nEven though it is unlikely to hit the same issue(s), it would be good to have such a run since eventually we might get some NFS specific spurious failures \n\nedit 1: make `$HOME` to also reside on NFS. We use fscacher which keeps cache at HOME and most likely on all those failing cases HOME was also under NFS, so yet another factor.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1680544405,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc5if0RWzwAAAAITa68L"},"added":["tests"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1680623922,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADODBZtRc5if0RWzwAAAAIUC5V0"},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"7a8552494914d3e4116f4b434eb4812a914ca405"},"timestamp":1680655276,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5ZNvKk","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1261#issuecomment-1496773284"},"message":"\u003c!-- GITHUB_RELEASE COMMENT: released --\u003e\n:rocket: Issue was released in [`0.52.0`](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/releases/tag/0.52.0) :rocket:","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"7a8552494914d3e4116f4b434eb4812a914ca405"},"timestamp":1680655277,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc5if0RWzwAAAAIUQ8uE"},"added":["released"],"removed":[]}]}
