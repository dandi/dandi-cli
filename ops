It would be super useful if there was some hint (maybe at least a link to the BIDS spec?) on how the file pattern can be fixed.\n\nI don't think there is an easy generic way to address this reliably.  Only may be for some cases to look at what entities used and either all are known and suggest closest matching legit ones if some nonlegit ones used.\n\nMay be if you provide some specific suggestions, we could see if could be coded up.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1724680648,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc6QunjwzwAAAANDTP_w"},"added":["UX"],"removed":[]}]}
