We'd just need a new GitHub Actions workflow that creates a tag, creates a GitHub release with autogenerated release notes using the GitHub API, and builds \u0026 uploads the project to PyPI.  The only problem would be triggering the workflow; the best option I can think of is to make the workflow manually triggered via a workflow dispatch event, but no matter what we pick, it seems we'd lose auto's ability to autodetermine the new version.","files":null}]}
