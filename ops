With a nuitka build of dandi client I think it would be feasible to wrap it into some \"installer\" so people could just download + install, and that would create the \"DANDI app\" \"icon\" to click on, so ppl could get to it without seeing a command line.  Do you know any other App which uses libhdf5 and has some nice GUI with cross-platform installer?","files":null}]}
