It can be interrupted only by ending the process...\n\nThis is not the same on ubuntu under Windows Substation for Linux. Ctrl-C (twice) works just fine there.\n\nPerhaps a separate issue, but the format of the output is also not as clean as it is on linux.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/310197/131894346-d429ab0c-090d-4c7c-9dd2-0f3397b8944d.png)","files":null}]}
