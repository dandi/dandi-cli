We definitely do should not maintain copies of such code, or have it outside of dandi space.\n \nI think it would have been better as a dedicated `dandicore` module but if dandi-api would depend on `dandi-cli` anyways (e.g. for metadata validation etc), so the benefit is not so obvious, and I dislike proliferation of modules/packages (requires more effort to maintain distributions etc).\n\nWDYT (attn: @dandi/dandiarchive and @dandi/dandi-cli ) ?","files":null}]}
