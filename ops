If the spec is cached, you can tell pynwb to use that spec by setting `load_namespaces` to `True`. This is particularly useful if you are using an extension, because pynwb can automatically infer simple types directly from a cached schema, which means you don't have to install and import that extension before reading the file. pynwb now caches the spec by default, so most newer files have this cached spec, even if no extensions are used. If you set `load_namespaces` to `True` for a file that has no cached spec, it will throw this harmless warning and default to the normal API. I think loading the namespace is a good idea in general. I've never seen it cause any harm, besides this warning.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1570499182,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTI3NjczNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/14#issuecomment-539276735"},"message":"I don't mind loading them if they are available.  My question is pretty much either I should set `load_namespaces` to anything for validation purposes.
