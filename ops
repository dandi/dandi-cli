I am not sure if it is worth tracking here for this reason, so I will close this issue since nothing to be done on client side IMHO.\n\nIn the longer run we need to workout \"deployment\" configuration which probably would be fed into redirector and any relevant component (avoiding any possible hard-coding which now might be present). Client should be informed about any relevant service endpoints by the deployment it would be talking to, and that is what aforementioned issues are trying to achieve.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1597115783,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY0MTI0ODk1OA=="},"status":2}]}
