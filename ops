So we should come up with a design for organizing the nwb associated video files on DANDI and update the link stored in the nwbfile. \n\n `dandi organize` for video files specifically should:\n1. Rename the video files prior to uploading on DANDI.\n2. Update the nwbfile in real time and change the external file link based on the new name of the video file. \n\n@satra @bendichter I have created a design draft for us to collaborate on\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1oclxWFRNbakjYBlrze4DiFWkh_v0yVhmGjNar09skx4/edit?usp=sharing","files":null}]}
