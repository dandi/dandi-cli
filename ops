It would be very close to what `git annex view` does.\n\nExamples of layouts found in the \"wild\" (thanks to @bendichter for summarizing, I hope it is ok to post here, slap me if I am wrong):\n\n## EC’s lab\n\ndata is stored across separate servers for PHI/HIPAA reasons, and the entire lab shares data, so they do not separate by experimenter:\n\n```\nraw/\n\tEC61/ (subject)\n\t\tEC61_B1/ (session)\n\t\t\tdata\nprocessed/\n\tEC61/\n\t\tEC61_B1/\nimaging/\n\tEC61/\n```\n\n## GB’s lab\n\n.. is probably the most common among neurophysiology labs that have a central data storage architecture at all. Here, subjects belong to specific experimenters who have unique subject naming conventions, so their first level is “experimenter”. Most of their data is shared publicly and you can navigate their file structure here (this is the data referenced by Peter’s Database).\n\n```\nSenzaiY/ (experimenter)\n\tYutaMouse-41/ (subject)\n\t\tYutaMouse-41-150819/ (session)\n\t\t\teeg.dat\n\t\t\tspikes.dat\n\t\t\t...\n```\n\nI like that the sessions are named by subject and date, because they are easy to manage by eye. \n\n## BIDS-like\n\nAnalogously to BIDS, we could use subject \u003e session. I think we should allow for a bit of extra meta-data around NWB files, so our structure could be something like:\n\n```\nsub-01/\n\tsub-01_20190505/\n\tdata\n\tdashboard_config.py\n\tsub-01_20190506/\nsub-02/\nsub-03/\nsub-04/\n```","files":null}]}
