Due to its ad-hoc life cycle not allowing merge of changes, we decided to make it readonly, with a comment in the top stating that and URL on web UI to modify it.\n\nWhile `organize` discovers missing metadata it could also suggest to go to that URL to provide recommended editions.","files":null}]}
