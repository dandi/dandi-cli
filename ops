So we will need two level of \"participant\". \n\nThe first represents \"the biological system\" (a mouse, a human, a organoid) over its life cycle.\nThe second a spatiotemporal snapshot (or sample) of the first because technically that is what is used in observation/measuring. \nThis separation will allow the same system to be imaged multiple times during its lifetime and postmortem.\n\nTo me, this would be the ideal separation. \n\n```\nasset wasGeneratedBy observation_activity\nobservation_activity generated asset\n\nobservation_activity used sample\n\nsample wasGeneratedBy sampling_activity\nsampling_activity generated sample\n\nsample_info wasGeneratedBy sampling_activity\nsampling_activity generated sample_info\n\nsampling_activity used participant\n\nsample wasDerivedFrom participant\nasset wasDerivedFrom sample\nasset wasDerivedFrom participant\n\n```\n\nsample_info is entity that hold information about age, sex, genotype (as these can change overtime)\n\nI know that in some cases the \"observation_activity\" and \"sampling_activity\" are actually intermingled in time.  But it is helpful for them to be logically separated.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a5673da7239602e50e6582ae13b46e84282b4377"},"timestamp":1617384853,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjYzMjI0Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/530#issuecomment-812632243"},"message":"The separation between the \"sample\", \"observation\" vs the system being observed is also used in this SOSA ontology.\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/\n\nI really think that it has lots of parallels here with neuroscience research methodologies.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a5673da7239602e50e6582ae13b46e84282b4377"},"timestamp":1617671516,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzc1MjU2MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/530#issuecomment-813752560"},"message":"If you are feeling brave, you can also separate out genotyping as activity in itself that was done independently and before the animal is used for physiology.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1659123876,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5HhOLY","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/530#issuecomment-1199891160"},"message":"I would assume that this was addressed in the context of the dandi-schema work.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1659123876,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADODBZtRc4yn7OHzwAAAAGms_m8"},"status":2}]}
