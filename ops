I did ~~not dare to  suggest yet to datalad folks since some agreement was reached at some point to \"not bother\"~~ (apparently I did click \"Save\" instead of \"Cancel\" ;) https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/4999), so would be nice to start here, gain some experience and then \"transfer\" to other projects if seem beneficial.\n\nWe should look into automating\n- changelog composition\n- release to pypi:\n   - conda-forge will pick up by itself and send a PR, alternatively/ideally in the long run -- we could of cause mint a PR, wait for it to finish and report back if all green and when we merge here, merge also that PR against conda-forge -- full automation!!!\n- later: \n  - release for debian as: build source package (so I could download, re-review, sign locally and upload to debian proper) + backports for neurodebian (probably can just automate)\n  - anything else?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1603730784,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjY3Nzg3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/252#issuecomment-716677874"},"message":"@yarikoptic I've continued working on the proof-of-concept repo I mentioned [here](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/4999#issuecomment-707278319), and it now automatically publishes to PyPI whenever a new release is created.
