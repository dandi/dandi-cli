Do you want each field's title to be hardcoded in the source or not?  Do you want those that aren't set in the source to be determined algorithmically at runtime?  Should this algorithmic determination be done by a standalone function that the user of the code calls, passing one field at a time to get a title, or should the code somehow automatically populate all the titles of all the fields before making anything available to the user?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1607006377,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODAzNTQwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/301#issuecomment-738035406"},"message":"- we should not hardcode in `dandi/models.py` where mapping is obvious, but allow for title to be specified there if \"custom\", e.g. ATM for `includeInCitation` we should keep `title=\"Include Contributor in Citation\"`, but we should remove hardcoded title where no custom is needed (e.g. `valueReference` in original description)\n- we should make https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/master/tools/pubschemata.py populate titles where missing upon `schema_json` call.  Most likely for that we need to overload `.schema_json` in our `DandiBaseModel` unless we find some more native way to achieve that with `pydantic` (may be it allows for defining some \"default\" handling of attributes?)\n\nDoes it make it clearer @jwodder ?\n\nDoes that sound sensible @satra @AlmightyYakob ?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1607013053,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODEyMDkwMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/301#issuecomment-738120900"},"message":"@yarikoptic I've figured out a way to do this, but it currently only seems to work for `Field`s, not `TypeModel`s like `MeasurementTechniqueType`.
