There is really no ideal solution to make them co-exist peacefully. E.g. even if we use (could not find ATM) pyout's ability for \"write through\" - those log lines would appear above rendering, and likely off the screen already.\nBut we already store all logs into a temp file which we announce to the user.  So I think a viable way forward would be\n- when using pyout, define our logging handler to be only the file one + \"pyout handler\"\n- when logging during pyout, \"pyout handler\" should inform pyout display that a log line was issued, and we add a counter (ideally actually separating by different log levels, e.g. ERRORS:1, WARNINGS:2 etc) to LOG column for that item\n- tricky part is association between log lines and pyout records, but I think could be worked out","files":null}]}
