That results in the script just being run as `migrate-dandisets.py https://api.dandiarchive.org/api $d`, i.e., with an empty list of Dandisets, so it does nothing.  I suggest enclosing `$DANDI_API_TOKEN` in double-quotes so that, when it's unset, an empty string will be passed in its place.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1617713449,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDA5NDExMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/532#issuecomment-814094111"},"message":"Yeah, should just do that, thanks!","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1617713449,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDU1NjU4OTE1Ng=="},"status":2}]}
