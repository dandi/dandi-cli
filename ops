I think it would be useful to have a test with a sizeable (\u003e100MB?) upload  to the instance in the fixture.\nIt might still be insufficient to trigger/test the logic there for validation and we should not waste effort on ensuring that ATM since validation might go completely offline in the future.  Having a sizeable upload would be useful though.","files":null}]}
