So I guess the only way to quickly achieve desired ATM would be to add option already existing in `upload`:\n\n```shell\n$\u003e DANDI_DEVEL=1 dandi upload --help                                                     \nUsage: dandi upload [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...\n...\n  -i, --dandi-instance [dandi|local-docker|local-girder-only]\n                                  For development: DANDI instance to use\n```\nso it could be then `DANDI_DEVEL=1 dandi download -i local-docker [URLs]` , and if instance specification conflicts with the one from URLs - raise an exception","files":null}]}
