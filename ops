Dandi was installed via the following steps: 1. install Anaconda (using Windows executable), 2. Create a conda environment with latest python version (conda create --name myenv python=3), which turns out to be 3.11.7. Then I used pip install to install the following packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, dandi, h5py, pynwb, pynapple. 3. Then I open a Spyder session and tried the command: from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient. That is what gave me the error. \n\nAs I said in a follow-up post (not sure its still visible after transferring this post to a different repository), I can successfully import DandiAPIClient when I uninstalled rpds-py (which I assume was installed with dandi) and then re-installed the package using the version of rpds-py released on 28th of Dec, via pip install rpds-py==0.16.2.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1707323461,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5zLncE","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1403#issuecomment-1932424964"},"message":"@NilsNyberg If you create a fresh Conda environment and install the latest version of rpds-py in it, can you do `import rpds` in that environment?
