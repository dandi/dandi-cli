Although I would need also to check if fscacher kicks in, so may be it would cache based on mtimes and size for folders  (zarrs) too, so might be a bit more efficient but not for zarr v2 with gzillions of files ;)","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1744859036,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc6y1BDGzwAAAAQHGZyR"},"added":["question"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1744859036,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc6y1BDGzwAAAAQHGZyT"},"added":["answered"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1744859038,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADODBZtRc6y1BDGzwAAAAQHGZ1N"},"status":2}]}
