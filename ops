For example, the shadowing happens in the debug environment of PyCharm which starts Python with something like\n\n```\n.../pydevd.py --file .../_jb_pytest_runner.py --path \u003cpath to local dandi package source\u003e\n```\n\nwhich adds the package directory `.../dandi-cli/dandi` directly to sys.path. Additionally, the setup of [importing from the `keyring` dependency](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/f5b8bc3eec06c375d73bdc6a05994585dc220d86/dandi/keyring.py#L9-L12) in side a file named `keyring.py` is quite confusing.\n\nI propose renaming the `keyring.py` file to `keyring_utils.py` or some other similar name.","files":null}]}
