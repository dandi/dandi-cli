An extractor should report \"as-is\". If the metadata source (like BIDS), it not \"semantically clean\", a subsequent (and updatable) transformation can be used to yield a \"better\" (or just different) record.\n\nI realized at some point that doing the standardization at the level of an extractor implies that any application of updates to that standardization requires actual data access, and also makes metadata *extraction* an inherently open-ended process. Adding the possibility to for customizable transformations of metadata seems much more practical, when data access is complicated (which it seems to be for most datasets).","files":null}]}
