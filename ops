But in many cases it would be expected and client might be used non-interactively.  We should come up with some uniform way to interface it.\n\nI would suggest `--yes` with choices applicable to the operation (e.g. `\"delete\"` for #616) and `nargs=*` or alike, so saying `--yes` would provide confirmation for all prompts (well, we could also make it explicit with `--yes all` or alike).\n\nWDYT @satra @jwodder","files":null}]}
