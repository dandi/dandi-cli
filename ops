Here, there is a processing module named \"behavior\" that only contains an `events` data type, which is generic and can hold different types of data. The `events` is named \"left nose poke times\", so it clearly holds behavioral data, but neither the processing module nor the events data object are behavior-specific so the dandi cli does not label this file as having behavioral data.\n\nThe solution I think Paul is suggesting here is to have the DANDI CLI parse that the file contains behavioral data if it contains a processing module named \"behavior.\" This type of processing module comes up a lot because it is one of our recommended names for processing modules: \"behavior\", \"ecephys\", \"ophys\", etc. This is indicated in our best practices document here: https://nwbinspector.readthedocs.io/en/dev/best_practices/nwbfile_metadata.html?highlight=processing#processing-module-names\n\nThe question is, do we want to use these types of heuristics to determine the file contents, or do we want to stick to neurodata types?","files":null}]}
