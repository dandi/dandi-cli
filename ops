Here is a few approaches we used/I am aware of\n\n- in https://github.com/ReproNim/containers , a code snippet in https://github.com/ReproNim/containers#a-typical-workflow is executed by CI https://github.com/ReproNim/containers/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yaml#L30 at least to gain some smoke testing\n- in DataLad we recorded demos which we showed via https://asciinema.org/   .  Similarish animated gif in https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/#to-cite-the-modules-and-methods-you-are-using .  In both cases, problem is that those snippets need to be tested!  So we got half-way there -- we wrote (and extracted into separate repo: https://github.com/datalad/screencaster) helpers to \"play out\" \"cast scripts\". E.g. https://github.com/datalad/screencaster/blob/master/cast2asciinema could be ran on the cast script like those in https://github.com/datalad/datalad/tree/maint/docs/casts .  Disclaimer: we haven't done that for years now since handbook.datalad.org folks generalized them I believe within their docs framework.\n \nSo I decided to try and running \n```\nSCREENCAST_HOME=/tmp/demo ./cast2asciinema ../datalad-maint/docs/casts/seamless_nested_repos.sh output.cast\n```\ngave me this cast: https://asciinema.org/a/cWrxRnQJlyQNLHg836qAwRbqA  (I believe there was some way to turn them also into gifs)\n\nSo, if someone were to do some \"catchy\" interactive demos\n- something like those casts could be used\n- they could be re-played out (without asciinema - just https://github.com/datalad/screencaster/blob/master/cast2script and run it) on CI to ensure that code is not breaking them\n\nsmth like that.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1675096707,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc5dJjo-zwAAAAH0GLtP"},"added":["documentation"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"1d7d442aa1925df5e89cbf71d597eb72205cfee1"},"timestamp":1675194780,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5UGcJ5","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1195#issuecomment-1410974329"},"message":"When you decide what approach you want for testing the doc examples, let us know and if @melster1010 is able to help with that technical writing at that point, she can get into it.","files":null}]}
