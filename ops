In https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/1599, I used https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/b697445062ea202f95d98a2e89925ba1196a363e/dandi/files/bids.py#L26-L31 to have the BIDS validator completely suppress the error regarding the `dandiset.yaml` file. If I take that configuration out, running `dandi validate` against a BIDS dandiset would produce the following error (with the severity of ERROR).\n\n```shell\n[BIDS.NOT_INCLUDED] /Users/isaac/Developer/Dartmouth/workshop/bids-error-examples/invalid_asl003/dandiset.yaml — Files with such naming scheme are not part of BIDS specification. This error is most commonly caused by typos in file names that make them not BIDS compatible. Please consult the specification and make sure your files are named correctly. If this is not a file naming issue (for example when including files not yet covered by the BIDS specification) you should include a \".bidsignore\" file in your dataset (see https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#bidsignore for details). Please note that derived (processed) data should be placed in /derivatives folder and source data (such as DICOMS or behavioural logs in proprietary formats) should be placed in the /sourcedata folder.\n```\n\nI think this error (or error message) is very informative, and taking out the configuration that suppresses it alone will achieve your intent. Of course, I can modify the message to give it some context of Dandi if you think that is better. However, I would advise against changing this message so that it has a severity of `Severity.HINT` or having the presence of `dandiset.yaml` be handled by logic that's separate from the BIDS validator because it is indeed a validation error per the BIDS standard.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1746223239,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6pw-2l","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1602#issuecomment-2848189861"},"message":"- yeah, let's stop \"ignoring\" and make it all proper BIDS\n- I think it would indeed be nice to adjust the message for dandiset.yaml specifically","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f3557c4ceea08ee5e22c6aab1e8604bfb798bfa4"},"timestamp":1746427126,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6p4ENL","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1602#issuecomment-2850046795"},"message":"\u003e * yeah, let's stop \"ignoring\" and make it all proper BIDS\n\u003e * I think it would indeed be nice to adjust the message for dandiset.yaml specifically\n\nThese changes are now part of #1599, and it closes this issue.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1747691498,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADODBZtRc6w3S5WzwAAAAQgWeE6"},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"7a8552494914d3e4116f4b434eb4812a914ca405"},"timestamp":1747871018,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6s0xEu","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1602#issuecomment-2899513646"},"message":"\u003c!-- GITHUB_RELEASE COMMENT: released --\u003e\n:rocket: Issue was released in [`0.69.0`](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/releases/tag/0.69.0) :rocket:","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"7a8552494914d3e4116f4b434eb4812a914ca405"},"timestamp":1747871019,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc6w3S5WzwAAAAQiuc5J"},"added":["released"],"removed":[]}]}
