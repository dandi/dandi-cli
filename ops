There are use cases which might ask for disabling or enabling some. Eg. \n\n- in cases of partial [uploads of BIDS datasets](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1734#issuecomment-3498630860)  we might want to disable bids-validator-deno as it would not have access to full dataset and just rely on bidsschematools which I believe we do not report otherwise (we do use it to extract metadata though)\n- ...\n\nSo I think we should add an option  like\n\n- `--validators auto,all,bidsschematools,bids-validator-deno,zarr,...`\n\nwhere currently it is like `auto` as we do not bother with bids-validator(s) if we do not see it being a bids dandiset. With `all` it would really enable all of them.\n\nAlso I now created `configuration` label to mark issues which would point to specific options people must be able to specify for their dandisets locally (or globally).","files":null}]}
