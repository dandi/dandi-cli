However, I am trying to upload a file (~34Gb) and at first I am able to reach 92% upload after a span of 36 hrs. I got the error shown. I assume it was a time out issue so I ran it again. I was told that if I ran the same command I did prior (dandi upload --existing-refresh) that it should continue from the last checkpoint. \n\nI got the same error the second time, but now at 32%\n\nQuestions:\n1. Is that 32% of what is left over or did it start up again?\n2. Why is this happening and would decreasing the number of files (increasing the chunk size) in the zarr store help (currently at 1.5 million)\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1919\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 6 05 48 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bbf868d-1464-4616-914c-5448c808c463\"\u003e","files":null}]}
