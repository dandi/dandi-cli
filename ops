But before then it runs a good number of tests which do not need it.  I thought that may be there is some setting or additional pytest plugin which would \"initiate\" session level fixtures while other tests are running since theoretically it could be done, and it could then speed up local runs of `pytest` considerably.\n\n@jwodder - may be you know some way?","files":null}]}
