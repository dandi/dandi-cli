I tried to do this by searching for `TwoPhotonSeries`, the neurodata_type that holds raw data from two-photon experiments. Several datasets e.g. https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000039/0.210902.2328 have \n\n\u003eVariable Measured: TwoPhotonSeries\n\nbut the files are clearly too small to contain such data, and when I open the files they are indeed missing this data. Why is this dandiset being annotated with TwoPhotonSeries?","files":null}]}
