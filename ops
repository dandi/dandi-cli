While I appreciate the change to a clearer name, neuroconv and NWB GUIDE still use \"dandi-staging\" internally. Other tools/scripts might as well? Would it be possible to accept \"dandi-staging\" as an alias for \"dandi-sandbox\" for a couple of months while we transition these tools to use \"dandi-sandbox\"?\n\nI ask for a couple of months because NWB GUIDE is currently locked to an older version of neuroconv, so even if [neuroconv updates](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv/issues/1484), it will still take effort to update GUIDE to use the latest neuroconv. This is on us to update, but if it is easy for the DANDI API to accept both \"dandi-staging\" and \"dandi-sandbox\" for a little time, it would give us some breathing room. Thanks","files":null}]}
