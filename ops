The list of software for the older runner is [here](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/macOS-11/20220605.1/images/macos/macos-11-Readme.md), and the software on the newer version is [here](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/macOS-11/20220614.2/images/macos/macos-11-Readme.md).  The only possibly relevant difference I see with a quick look is that Python 3.10 was upgraded from 3.10.4 to 3.10.5.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1655407658,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc5L76KBzwAAAAGWtsJG"},"added":["tests"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1655408229,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5FBqBz","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1032#issuecomment-1158062195"},"message":"Issue known to numcodecs?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1655409032,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5FBsXD","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1032#issuecomment-1158071747"},"message":"@yarikoptic It is now: https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/326","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1655543638,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5FGxqh","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1032#issuecomment-1159404193"},"message":"Thanks!  since already fixed in `main` I guess we will just wait until some day it would release and finally we stop getting angry emails from cron jobs","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1656358585,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5FmzDM","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1032#issuecomment-1167798476"},"message":"This has been resolved by a new numcodecs release.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1656358585,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADODBZtRc5L76KBzwAAAAGajvny"},"status":2}]}
