Or here more even -- should we try to authenticate or not.  What you are really looking here is not to force authentication on you if you do not have the key, right @sneakers-the-rat ?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f3856669ae05db18871381e4a2bf44e84858d017"},"timestamp":1700607260,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5slt2n","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1362#issuecomment-1821826471"},"message":"Right right - for a programmatic mode where I can catch the auth error from a call to `download`, but also keep interactive mode when invoked from click since interactive prompt makes sense there. A clean separation between interactive and noninteractive would be v useful for tools built on top of DANDI - rather than needing to write something separate to access API, would be nice to use this package. \n\nthere are ways to work around the problem, but they feel like hacks / prevent using the straightforward `download` method. So as a mild motivating example - if im writing a graph crawler, as I am, and I attempt to dereference some link to an embargoed dataset, I want to be able to handle that as a crawl failure as a standard part of the crawler API (ie. DANDI as one of many crawlers that have shared logic) rather than writing special workaround logic to handle that.\n\nIt might be an opportunity to standardize some of the args pass through the relevant functions too, and like I said im happy to draft any PR depending on what approach yall like best","files":null}]}
