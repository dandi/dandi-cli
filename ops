Our potential approach via\n- https://github.com/dandi/dandi-archive/pull/1892\n\nI do not think would elevate that, unless we explicitly code for it as e.g. allowing explicit released/versioned zarr assets \"upload\" (would be quick since no data upload really) thus simply reusing existing manifests, but disallowing changes to zarrs.  Something to indeed consider.  Do you think it would suffice for your use case?","files":null}]}
