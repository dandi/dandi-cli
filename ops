E.g. if we limit Deleter to be able to operate only on a single dandiset instance (so url and id must stay the same), `set_dandiset` could be invoked in constructor... yet to recall what use cases we want to fulfill, but ran into it while reviewing https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/605/files#","files":null}]}
