Filed https://github.com/dandi/dandi-api-datasets/issues/23 (I better don't do anything possibly destructive ATM).  When it gets fixed those dandiset.yaml will get updated and should reflect newer version.\n\nBut in your case @djarecka it shouldn't matter much -- just load straight from a dandiset using that code snippet to have it converted to the most up to date schema, and proceed from there.\n\nBTW -- of interest and immediate relevance https://github.com/dandi/dandi-api/issues/180","files":null}]}
