I think we should keep them all lower case for consistency etc.\n\nNB I also thought to say that we should align them to https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv  but I see now that it is more specific there and then should be `sha2-256` ... not sure if we should jump to align with the multicodec right away .","files":null}]}
