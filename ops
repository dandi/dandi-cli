E.g. for `upload --existing` we already have `error|skip|force|overwrite|refresh` which cover various use cases.  We could of cause double it with requiring additional `--yes` if actual `force` or `overwrite` or `refresh` is to annihilate previous file, but sounds like a not so useful duplication...","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"12cb25e6e3f19b53447b05d00d7d4d53c925c908"},"timestamp":1586471902,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTc4NzQ1OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/48#issuecomment-611787459"},"message":"so storing our `object id --\u003e filepath` somewhere on dandi should help with updates.\n\n(i still think we should add some checksum to file metadata)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1586472482,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTc5MDM3OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/48#issuecomment-611790379"},"message":"I don't think it would be needed - we will just get full list of assets in remote end first, they will include their remote path and object is.
