We will now be storing some of the data in DANDI Archive (and some on lincbrain.org) so s3invsync won't work for our use case as is currently implemented and we are using Zarr v3 with sharding so we will have much fewer files.\n\n## Question\n\nDoes `dandi download --sync` use a checksum to find and delete the local assets that are no longer on the remote server?  Or is it just based off of the file path?\n\nThanks.\n\ncc @aaronkanzer","files":null}]}
