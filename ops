Can be ran locally and in a web browser \n- https://github.com/ome/ome-ngff-validator for .ome.zarr folders. We have it already integrated at the level of dandiarchive web ui as external service, but then immediately opening first .ome.zarr says that it is not compliant :-/ (didn't investigate further)\n\nAny ideas @jwodder??? \n\nthe only one which comes to mind is to resort to docker or podman if installed on the system to run them in their containerized versions.","files":null}]}
