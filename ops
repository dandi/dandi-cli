Since `sub-RAT123` has only one file I would expect that the command without `-r` should be sufficient.\n\n```\n(dandicli_dev_py39) MacBook-Pro-2:000027 dorota$ ls -l sub-RAT123/\ntotal 40\n-rw-r--r--  1 dorota  staff  18792 Oct 21  2020 sub-RAT123.nwb\n(dandicli_dev_py39) MacBook-Pro-2:000027 dorota$ \n(dandicli_dev_py39) MacBook-Pro-2:000027 dorota$ dandi ls sub-RAT123/\n2022-10-04 16:06:48,825 [ WARNING] A newer version (0.46.3) of dandi/dandi-cli is available.
