I am not sure if there any specific field which says that \"file includes extensions X, Y, Z\" it is rather that namespace might not be found and then pynwb would just crash with KeyError (thus our ad-hoc detection), and you need to know what module to import **before** trying to load that nwb file.\n\nso, overall, I think it is worthwhile suggesting to nwb-schema some explicit attribute which would list extensions embedded within the file, but even if I could load (and ATM I and others can't  see https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/1335, https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/1337) it would be resource intensive, thus not easy to go through all thousands of files to figure out e.g. which ones use extension X.  That is why I thought that it might be worth for us to extract that knowledge within our metadata records.","files":null}]}
