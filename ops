If we do grow too much, we will look into splitting etc, but I think we might be ok. I think I will establish `dandi-logs` organization under which we will push all the goodness eventually using datalad helpers to create all the subdatasets on github, but for now could just live on drogon.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1621265219,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjQxNzQ4OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/639#issuecomment-842417489"},"message":"@yarikoptic I've added the \"release\" label to https://github.com/con/tinuous/pull/48, so we just need to merge that.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1621266910,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjQzOTE5OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/639#issuecomment-842439199"},"message":"@yarikoptic I've set up a cronjob to run every 6 hours that saves dandi-cli logs to `~/cronlib/tinuous-logs/dandi-cli`.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1621266917,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDc1NTUxMTc5NA=="},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1621270580,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjQ4MjEwMw==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/639#issuecomment-842482103"},"message":"- it shouldn't take long to run, should we may be run it each hour?\n- shouldn't we add flock to avoid possible conflicts if some eager one of us decides to \"fetch now\"?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1621270698,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjQ4MzM5OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/639#issuecomment-842483398"},"message":"@yarikoptic Changed to once an hour, and flock added.","files":null}]}
