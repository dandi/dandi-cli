They appear to both be failing because the just-uploaded file can't be found on Girder.  This happens when testing commits 82e1820, f31e469, and bee7d50 (the 0.6.0 tag), the last two of which succeeded when initially run on GitHub Actions.  All tests were run using tox in a clean repository with the most recent versions of the Docker images.\n\nMy current hypothesis is that a dependency released a new version that broke something.","files":null}]}
