That could be avoided.  Pagination output returns `count` in the initial response. our pagination is simple as in specify the page number (no \"next\" token).  So it should be trivial to \n- estimate how many pages we would need `ceil(count/page_size)`\n- send multiple requests in parallel e.g. for the next 5 pages\n- assemble them back in original order\n\npagination is similar for other end points (e.g. `/dandisets/{versions__dandiset__pk}/versions/{versions__version}/assets/paths/`) and I think overall generic. So I think we can implement it generally for any pagination requests to submit multiple pages requests in parallel and speed up interactions with the archive this way.","files":null}]}
