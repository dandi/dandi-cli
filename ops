It can be interrupted only by ending the process...\n\nThis is not the same on ubuntu under Windows Substation for Linux. Ctrl-C (twice) works just fine there.\n\nPerhaps a separate issue, but the format of the output is also not as clean as it is on linux.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/310197/131894346-d429ab0c-090d-4c7c-9dd2-0f3397b8944d.png)","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1731514144,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc461LWczwAAAAOPGFMY"},"added":["UX"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1731514148,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc6Tdx-s","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/766#issuecomment-2474057644"},"message":"Hi @rly .
