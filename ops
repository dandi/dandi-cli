I declare my LINC Archive API key in the `DANDI_API_KEY` environment variable with `export DANDI_API_KEY=\u003ctoken\u003e`.  Then I run the following code snippet which prompts for the API Key for LINC, and then for my password for encrypted keyring (which I can't remember).  \n\n```python\nfrom dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient\nclient = DandiAPIClient(\"https://api.lincbrain.org/api\")\nclient.dandi_authenticate()\n```\n\nWhy do I get prompted for keyring?  Thanks.","files":null}]}
