We do similar already in https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/blob/master/.github/workflows/template/build-%7B%7Bostype%7D%7D.yaml.j2#L443 so recipe could be adopted here.\n\nEven though it is unlikely to hit the same issue(s), it would be good to have such a run since eventually we might get some NFS specific spurious failures","files":null}]}
