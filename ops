I would like something like:\n\n```python\ndandiset.get_owners() or dandiset.owners\n```\n\nthis could return just the github usernames, e.g. \n```\n[\"bendichter\", \"luiztauffer\"]\n```\n\nor a list of dictionaries with more information: \n\n```\n[\n    {\"github_username\": \"bendichter\", \"name\": Ben Dichter\"},\n    {\"github_username\": \"luiztauffer\", \"name\": \"Luiz Tauffer\"},\n]\n```\n\n\nFor context, I was talking to Jerome Lecoq about a dandiset he owns and he said he lost access. \n\n\u003e Hi Ben, somehow I lost access to [[Allen Institute Openscope - Meaningful project](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000036)] too ! I suspect this is some entry in the database that could corrupted?\n\nI suspected that Jerome might have two different GitHub accounts that are both registered with DANDI and I wanted to use the python API to determine what GitHub account owns this dandiset. Both GitHub accounts could have the display name \"Jerome Lecoq\" so the web UI display is not helpful here:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"260\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/844306/217364388-ff5b1cc2-e956-4ef8-9cc9-378a1503d8a3.png\"\u003e\n\nIs there a convenient way to access this information? Is this already implemented somewhere?","files":null}]}
