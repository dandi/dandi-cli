I have decided against since some times it results in one failing and another succeeding and it provides information:\n- if fails for `push` -- that means that some code path causes trouble as in current state in development of that PR but it would be gone (no longer covered by test? just magically disappearing?) when merged\n- if fails for `pull` -- tests pass on development, but then if merged, would fail -- \"rebase\" or \"merge\" is due to bring those failures to the development environment\n\nWith that in mind I would just keep it as is for now, and we might reconsider it later, unless there is some negative effect we want to mitigate (beyond twice more notifications) -- then reopen please.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1597166684,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY0NDI0MDg1OQ=="},"status":2}]}
