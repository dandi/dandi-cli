We could then establish a trail of UUIDs for a file, not unlike git history where parent commit which contained previous version of the file is known.  This could provide a reliable mechanism for \"fast-forward\" updates to/from dandiarchive.  Any possible conflicts (divergence in the history of the trail, thus requiring a merge) would be beyond the scope here, although we could provide the tool to review the differences (if any) and accept one version or another or establish a \"merged\" one.","files":null}]}
