In case of `upload` we can determine the top by presence of `dandiset.yaml` for any path if pointed to while being outside of the dandiset.  It is very similar situation/behavior of what we used to have in datalad for `get`, `install` etc, but it was deprecated in favor of an explicit `-d` when performing operation outside of a dataset.  Complicating factor there was also having both cli and Python API with classes, so it makes sense for any `Dataset(\"path\").command(\"relpath\")` treat `\"relpath\"` relative to the \"path\" regardless of the current directory.  Here we have a much simpler usecase.","files":null}]}
