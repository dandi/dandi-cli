I haven't uploaded to DANDI in a while, so upgraded the DANDI Client (`pip install dandi --upgrade`) to 0.62.4.\n2. Ran `dandi -l debug upload -i dandi-staging https://gui-staging.dandiarchive.org/dandiset/215229/draft`, which returned the following error:\n    ```\n    Error: Server requires schema version 0.6.8; client only supports 0.6.6.  You may need to upgrade dandi and/or dandischema.\n    ```\n3. The installed `dandischema` version was `0.10.0`.  When I upgraded `dandischema` to `0.10.2`, I no longer received the schema mismatch error.\n\n## Possible solution\n\n1. Could we start to pin the `dandischema` version more strictly in the DANDI Client's requirements so that this mismatch is avoided?  Currently it is set to a range (i.e. `dandischema \u003e= 0.9.0, \u003c 0.11`) and so it does not necessarily get upgraded when `dandi` is upgraded.\n\nThank you.","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"d8203afd43c9e0a9d07c45dd62b58a81d53a2ebe"},"timestamp":1721688651,"metadata":{"github-id":"UCE_lAHODBZtRc6QeQxozmBVZuc"},"target":"9edd3c0c940deff5209e80e6cc36911a82645ddb74da149f3c429151980bee71","message":"## Description\n\nHi team, the following steps recreate an issue I have run into today and in the past:\n\n1.
