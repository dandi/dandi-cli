I guess we could add this option and then treat local paths as globs to be expanded by python locally and on the server. For URLs we would need some custom URI schema to indicate that it is a glob for a particular dandiset (e.g. `dandi-glob://\u003cinstance name\u003e/\u003cdandiset id\u003e[@\u003cversion\u003e][/\u003cglob\u003e]`)\n\nWDYT @jwodder \n\nPrompted by \n\n- https://github.com/dandi/helpdesk/discussions/139\n\nalthough not yet known if really needed in that case.","files":null}]}
