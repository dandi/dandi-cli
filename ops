The only reason you're seeing that error is because the underlying function failed while fscacher was handling the `TypeError`, so the latter got included in the traceback.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"364914f8b1c8a9131d300bf2978e4ffe2ff1aeeb"},"timestamp":1717693566,"metadata":{"github-id":"CE_lADODBZtRc6LZc1bzwAAAAMLBaia"},"status":2}]}
