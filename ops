In fact, the [documentation on the archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/handbook/13_upload/#data-uploadmanagement-workflow) still suggest this as the workflow prior to doing anything else.\n\nYet I know get an error using `dandi==0.49.0`\n\n```\ndandi validate test_upload.nwb\n[DANDI.NO_DANDISET_FOUND] test_upload.nwb — File is not inside a Dandiset\n```\n\nI feel like the `DANDI.NO_DANDISET_FOUND` check should not be run when the file is not yet inside the dandiset.\n\nEither that or someone needs to update the documentation for everything related to this.","files":null}]}
