We have `--download dandiset.yaml` and we can point to any specific file or folder.\n\n\u003e if we could simply point to a file for download and say optionally to make it a valid dandiset\n\nFor BIDS I don't think it is feasible to reliably encode all the needed logic to encode all the dependencies between files with all the inheritance principles etc. Even for NWBs it would need to be done to assess for all external referenced files and then possibly to download them or not.\n\n\u003e without necessarily going the datalad route.\n\noh well -- DataLad should work quite nicely for this use case  and if not - would be easy to make it work.  I don't see another simple way to accomplish the drill here really beyond what we already have + users figuring out what to download for such partial views.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"12cb25e6e3f19b53447b05d00d7d4d53c925c908"},"timestamp":1658414872,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5HBgrV","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1075#issuecomment-1191578325"},"message":"users will not be able to figure this out or necessarily use datalad. i would put it out of reach for many of these folks. for most datasets they will be able to download all of it. i agree with your assessment, but that's the challenge i am calling out here. figuring out what is needed. \n\nonce we have the bids validator in, we will want people to use it, not bypass it. giacomo is not going to have all the data as an example to upload. and even if he can use datalad, others on that team in different institutions absolutely cannot, and they are not going to download all the data either to upload a few excel files. \n\nso they need a pathway to create a sub dataset that they can validate and upload. just a note, for them even the python client was a challenge and sometimes they sent files to another site to upload. usability cannot be only for technically savvy people, which is where it is currently.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1658416297,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5HBnbh","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1075#issuecomment-1191605985"},"message":"I hear you, but also we need to be pragmatic.
