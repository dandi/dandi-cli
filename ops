I think the easiest/best would be to extend `dandi_authenticate` which takes care about storing token in keyring, with `token: Optional[str]=None` parameter which would provide the token to be used **and** be stored if provided.  No other mechanisms (keyring/env var) should be queried for a key in this case.","files":null}]}
