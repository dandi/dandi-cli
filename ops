For the LINC project, we are working towards uploading BIDS compliant datasets.\n\n1. Sometimes, I have forgotten to add the `dataset_description.json` file for a new dataset/Dandiset.\n2. Other times, a user wants to change the metadata in the sidecar JSON file.\n    1. They don't have the entire dataset/Dandiset stored locally because the Zarr files are \u003e1 TB.\n    2. So they download the dandiset.yaml file, download the sidecar JSON file, create the dataset/Dandiset directory tree, place the JSON file in the correct location within the tree, and modify the JSON file.\n    3.
