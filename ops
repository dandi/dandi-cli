Currently it only checks individual file paths for being kosher. I am not sure if \"Python reimplementation of full fledged bids-validator\" would ever materialize. May be smth like https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator/issues/1387 would be the solution. Somewhat more recent discussion is in https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-2-devel/issues/41#issuecomment-1668179615 . @effigies do you know of any other issue/long term plan/goal for seeing Python based bids-validator?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"d529b7cd76c3ce2ae50e15092ade38aa78c9ccb1"},"timestamp":1694193751,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDODBZtRc5mCwV_","github-url":"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1324#issuecomment-1711998335"},"message":"I have a vague goal of eventually fleshing out the Python validator, but it is not on a roadmap or even a backlog. To the extent that we want to do it, I think the highest-order benefits would be in validating the schema itself and providing a reference implementation of inheritance.\n\nIMO having a second implementation of many of the rules will have limited utility, so I would really chip away at it based on concrete needs like this. \n\nFor checking datafile/sidecar pairings, I believe the JS approach is to construct all of the sidecar views according to the inheritance principle, marking each JSON file as \"read\" in the process. If at the end, there are any unread JSON files, a warning could be raised. For the reverse problem, running the checks in `rules.sidecars` would do the trick, as long as there is one required metadata field.\n\nAll that said, I would have expected the path above to be flagged by the current schema validator.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"34bb3b7763ea6d04cae1c21ede40209df34305b5"},"timestamp":1721326113,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADODBZtRc5whZJAzwAAAAMoRdmJ"},"added":["zarr"],"removed":[]}]}
