So our tests pass (since testing in isolation) -- but real upload fails since on the main deployment metadata records are different... heh\n\nI think we need a test for that: download 000027 from the main archive, and upload to the local fixture instance.\n\nMeanwhile I will look into just fixing up the code so `upload` works again.","files":null}]}
