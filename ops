But then we would have difficulty of associating logs with a test.  Well -- may be there is an easy way to cause pytest to run some fixture before each test, which would then log the name of the test in our logger -- this way we could associate log lines with tests.  But not sure if this would be the best way since too ad-hoc","files":null}]}
