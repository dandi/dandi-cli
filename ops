The `/info` endpoint being hit (whether staging or prod) does not recognize the untagged version either\n\nA plausible solution here would be to introduce a `--bypass-version-validation` flag into the CLI, so that testing against a production/staging environment can occur without commenting out code -- as displayed, for instance, here: https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/1519#discussion_r1843905312\n\nLet me know your thoughts @jwodder @yarikoptic -- perhaps you already have a workflow here that is yet to be documented -- thanks in advance\n\n Cc @kabilar","files":null}]}
