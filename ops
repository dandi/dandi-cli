ATM all invocations pass in just a single exception as a list:\n\n```shell\n❯ git grep -A1 pydantic_errors_to_validation_results\ndandi/files/bases.py:                return _pydantic_errors_to_validation_results(\ndandi/files/bases.py-                    [e], str(self.filepath), dandiset_path=self.dandiset_path\n--\ndandi/files/bases.py:                return _pydantic_errors_to_validation_results(\ndandi/files/bases.py-                    [e], str(self.filepath), dandiset_path=self.dandiset_path\n--\ndandi/files/bases.py:                return _pydantic_errors_to_validation_results(\ndandi/files/bases.py-                    [e], str(self.filepath), dandiset_path=self.dandiset_path\n--\ndandi/files/bases.py:def _pydantic_errors_to_validation_results(\ndandi/files/bases.py-    errors: list[dict | Exception],\n```\n\nso it makes no sense to have a loop inside then . I think the idea was to pass a single exception and loop though contained in it errors.
