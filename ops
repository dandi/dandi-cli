I think the top-level ToC is pretty sparse, and moving (or copying, linking) that to an `examples` section in the top level ToC would make that a lot more visible. \n\n\u003e Should we may be point to it from a few locations, e.g. https://www.dandiarchive.org/handbook/10_using_dandi/#dandi-python-client ?\n\u003e \n\u003e edit: to the same page in handbook add also a little section on presence of API server https://api.dandiarchive.org/ which provides various \"interactive\" interfaces like https://api.dandiarchive.org/swagger/ and https://api.dandiarchive.org/redoc/ for interaction with the API.\n\ndefinitely a big fan of dense linking - so yes! a clear navigation path where one would find examples would suit the bill. Since this kind of stuff is examples of how to use this package in particular, i think it would fit here. \n\n\u003e and above you just keep digging the \"Command line interface\", which is the oldest and possibly most archaic code in here ;-)\n\nFair enough! I'm playing the role here of \"naive user trying to help with docs\" since i'm sure this all makes sense to y'all and the question is probably annoying. I promise i'm not just being dense on purpose and trying to help smooth some of those documentation desire paths :). My baseless assertion \"seems like its primarily oriented around the cli commands\" was mostly from the way they are highlighted in the docs, and when i go to the high-, mid-, or low-level interfaces links i just get a big wall of links which signaled to me \"not the usual thing we intend people to look at\" - eg. the `download` function is this lonely soul at the bottom of the page and I assumed i wasn't supposed to be touching it.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"803\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-11-22 at 6 15 31 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/assets/12961499/074b109d-ffa2-4183-af07-ab92cc54f02f\"\u003e","files":null}]}
