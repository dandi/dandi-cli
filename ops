Thanks to the feedback from @rly on nwb slack channel:\n\nfrom the path, i guess that the user wishes to store spike times in a TimeSeries. the most straightforward way to do that right now is to put the spike times in the timestamps array, but the data array is still required. here, until we implement a proper Events type (see https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema/issues/301), i recommend the user create a dummy array data consisting of ones for every value in the timestamps array.\n\nWhich gave me an idea that we might want to post-process some of the pynwb validation errors and provide guesses on what could have lead to them and how to mitigate.","files":null}]}
