There is a \"concise\" SUMMARY which it starts with, includes the full signature (not just `[OPTIONS]`) and user then is given a choice for details to be provided below.  That avoids the need for looking up extra information online for that command.\n\nIf it is really desired to have different `help`, it is easy to workaround the fact that sphinx-click does not allow two.  We can have a helper `click_help(short, long)` so it is like `help=click_help(None, \"Provided long description only in sphinx\")` or alike, and inside `click_help` decides between the two based e.g. on DANDI_DOC_LONG_HELP env var which it sets while building docs.  But, again, I do not really see why `--help` should be crippled.\n\nAnother way for concise/long is `-h` vs `--help` we support in datalad:\n```\n$\u003e datalad clone -h\nUsage: datalad clone [-h] [-d DATASET] [-D DESCRIPTION] [--reckless [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]] [--version] SOURCE [PATH] ...\n\nUse '--help' to get more comprehensive information.\n\n$\u003e datalad clone --help | head\nUsage: datalad clone [-h] [-d DATASET] [-D DESCRIPTION]\n                     [--reckless [auto|ephemeral|shared-...]] [--version]\n                     SOURCE [PATH] ...\n\nObtain a dataset (copy) from a URL or local directory\n\nThe purpose of this command is to obtain a new clone (copy) of a dataset\nand place it into a not-yet-existing or empty directory. As such CLONE\n...\n```\nbut frankly I rarely if ever use `-h`","files":null}]}
