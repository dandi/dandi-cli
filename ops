We do it from the beginning of the file, which might be just a waste of bandwidth and \"not productive\".  Ideally we should just \n- roll back a little to position e.g. `Y=downloaded - 2*chunk_size`\n- instruct downloader to get a stream from `Y` (not sure if girder allows, so might need to become only for direct downloads from S3)\n- download first chunk (again -- the same up to 3 times rule) and compare to the content in previously downloaded -- it matches -- proceed with writing to the file starting at position `downloaded - chunk_size`, if not -- bail and try downloading from beginning.","files":null}]}
