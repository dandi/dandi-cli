AB  - A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0 (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant, which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems. This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.

AB  - We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination  with a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM  neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity  that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay  activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect.  Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete  collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished  thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in  motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal  excitation across multiple brain areas.

AB  - The enclosed data is collected using a high-density 256-channel electrocorticography (ECoG) array implanted in human patients during treatment for epilepsy. The subjects are reading aloud consonant-vowel syllables from a list. The data was collected by Dr. Edward Chang and Dr. Kristofer Bouchard at the University of California, San Francisco, and curated by Dr. Kristofer Bouchard and Dr. Benjamin Dichter.


Data is organized by subject ID, and each file is a continuous recording session in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) 2.0 format. Voltage traces are included for each of the recorded 256 channels. Microphone signal was recorded at the time but is removed for HIPAA compliance. Detailed hand-marked annotations are provided which mark what syllable was said, and the times of the start, consonant-vowel transition, and end of each syllable. A rest-period time is also included when the subject was silent, which can be used as a baseline. Hand-marked anatomical labels are included for electrodes in the relevant brain regions. All dates have been removed for HIPAA compliance and replaced with Jan 1, 1900.

T1  - Allen Institute Openscope - Measuring Stimulus-Evoked Neurophysiological Differentiation in Distinct Populations of Neurons in Mouse Visual Cortex

AB  - Despite significant progress in understanding neural coding, it remains unclear how the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons relates to what an observer actually perceives. Since neurophysiological differences must underlie differences among percepts, differentiation analysis-quantifying distinct patterns of neurophysiological activity-has been proposed as an "inside-out" approach that addresses this question. This methodology contrasts with "outside-in" approaches such as feature tuning and decoding analyses, which are defined in terms of extrinsic experimental variables. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in mice of both sexes to systematically survey stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation (ND) in excitatory neuronal populations in layers (L)2/3, L4, and L5 across five visual cortical areas (primary, lateromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and anteromedial) in response to naturalistic and phase-scrambled movie stimuli. We find that unscrambled stimuli evoke greater ND than scrambled stimuli specifically in L2/3 of the anterolateral and anteromedial areas, and that this effect is modulated by arousal state and locomotion. By contrast, decoding performance was far above chance and did not vary substantially across areas and layers. Differentiation also differed within the unscrambled stimulus set, suggesting that differentiation analysis may be used to probe the ethological relevance of individual stimuli.

AB  - This dataset was collected for the Credit Assignment project, as part of the Allen Institute for Brain Science's OpenScope project. The most up-to-date links to the publications associated with this dataset (a dataset descriptor paper and an analysis paper) can be found by going to the metadata Github repository, linked below.

Briefly, mice were habituated to head-fixation on a running disc over a period of 11 days. Over the last 6 days, mice were presented with repeating stimulus sequences, with consistent features. These sessions are not included in the dataset, as imaging was not performed. Following habituation, sequences with inconsistent features were introduced over three sessions, while two-photon calcium imaging was performed in pyramidal neurons of primary visual cortex (VisP). Specifically, recordings for each mouse were made in one of four planes: L2/3 somata, L5 somata, L2/3 distal apical dendrites or L5 distal apical dendrites. As mice gained experience with the inconsistent sequences, responses to these events were found to evolve in opposite ways in the dendritic and somatic compartments.

The dataset includes 50 sessions total, recorded in 13 subjects, with at least 3 sessions per subject. Each session file includes: **(1)** ROI dF/F traces, **(2)** ROI masks, **(3)** ROI tracking information (where applicable), **(4)** running velocity traces, **(5)** pupil diameter traces, **(6)** pupil centroid position traces in x and y, **(7)** stimulus parameters. Note that gaze was not computed for this dataset. What is provided is the position of the pupil centroid in the pupil recording videos. In addition, a second, slightly larger version of each file was created, also including: **(8)** stimulus frame images (identifiable by `+image` in the file name). Lastly, a third, much larger version of each file was created, also including: **(9)** the motion corrected imaging stack (identifiable by `_obj-raw` in the file name).

Certain sessions in this dataset were excluded from our analyses for quality control reasons. They are provided here, as the reasons we excluded them from our analyses may not pose a problem for all use cases.

AB  - Data was recorded using silicon probe electrodes in the frontal cortices of male Long Evans rats between 4-7 months of age. The design was to have no specific behavior, task or stimulus, rather the animal was left alone in it’s home cage (which it lives in at all
times). Data includes both local field potentials (LFP) and spikes. 11 total animals, 27 recording sessions, 1360 total units recorded, 1121 units considered stable, 995 putative excitatory units and 126 putative inhibitory units. Only recordings including a “WAKE-SLEEP” episode wherein at least 7 minutes of wake are followed by 20 minutes of sleep. On average 2 such WAKE-SLEEP episodes per recording session.

AB  - This data set is composed of eight bilateral silicon-probe multi-cellular electrophysiological recordings performed on four male Long-Evans rats in the Buzsáki lab at NYU. These recordings were performed to assess the effect of novel spatial learning on hippocampal CA1 neural firing and LFP patterns in naïve animals. Each session consisted of a long (~4 hour) PRE rest/sleep epoch home-cage recordings performed in a familiar room, followed by a Novel MAZE running epoch (~45 minutes) in which the animals were transferred to a novel room, and water-rewarded to run on a novel maze. These mazes were either A) a wooden 1.6m linear platform, B) a wooden 1m diameter circular platform or C) a 2m metal linear platform. Animals were rewarded either at both ends of the linear platform, or at a predetermined location on the circular platform. The animal was gently encouraged to run unidirectionally on the circular platform. After the MAZE epochs the animals were transferred back to their home-cage in the familiar room where a long (~4 hour) POST rest/sleep was recorded. All eight sessions were concatenated from the PRE, MAZE, and POST recording epochs. In addition to hippocampal electrophysiological recordings, neck EMG and head-mounted accelerometer signals were recorded, and the animal’s position during MAZE running epochs was tracked via head-mounted LEDs.

AB  - This dataset is a result of a multi-institution, cross country collaboration of labs, called International Brain Laboratory conducting standardized experiments on decision-making in mice. In the experiment, mice are shown a visual grating on screen with varying levels of contrast, and they are trained to rotate a wheel to move the on-screen stimulus from either side of their visual field to the center. These NWB files contain datasets corresponding to this wheel movement, camera footage of mice and information about the visual stimulus at every trial.

AB  - This dataset is a result of a multi-institution, cross country collaboration of labs, called International Brain Laboratory conducting standardized experiments on decision-making in mice. In the experiment, mice are shown a visual grating on screen with varying levels of contrast, and they are trained to rotate a wheel to move the on-screen stimulus from either side of their visual field to the center. These NWB files contain datasets corresponding to this wheel movement, camera footage of mice and information about the visual stimulus at every trial.

AB  - A two photon calcium imaging dataset from Allen Institute measuring responses to full-field drifting gratings (approx. 120x90 degrees of visual space) moving in 4 different directions, at 5 spatial frequencies (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 cpd), and 5 temporal frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 Hz). The ratio of TF/SF is speed (deg/sec) and the extent to which visual neurons exhibit speed tuning has been shown to vary across some cortical areas (Andermann et al. 2011).
Mouse Cre lines expressing GCaMPf were imaged to record responses of pyramidal neurons across cortical layers (Cux2: layer 2/3; Rorb: layer 4; Rbp4: layer 5; Ntsr1: layer 6) as well as somatostatin inhibitory interneurons (Sst). All Cre lines were imaged in VISp, and some (Cux2 and Sst) were also imaged in VISl, VISal, VISpm, VISam, and VISrl. All experimental sessions took place on the same data collection pipeline as the Allen Brain Observatory (see de Vries, Lecoq, Buice et al. 2020) and have the same visual stimulus monitor calibration and positioning, two photon imaging systems and image processing pipeline, and running wheel to track locomotion.

AB  - Understanding the neural basis of human movement in naturalistic scenarios is critical for expanding neuroscience research beyond constrained laboratory paradigms. The neural correlates of unstructured, spontaneous movements in completely naturalistic settings have rarely been studied, due in large part to a lack of available data. Here, we present our Annotated Joints in Long-term Electrocorticography for 12 human participants (AJILE12) dataset, the largest human neurobehavioral dataset that is publicly available; the dataset was recorded opportunistically during passive clinical epilepsy monitoring. AJILE12 includes synchronized intracranial neural recordings and upper body pose trajectories across 55 semi-continuous days of naturalistic movements, along with relevant metadata, including thousands of wrist movement events and annotated behavioral states. Neural recordings are available at 500 Hz from at least 64 electrodes per participant, for a total of 1280 hours. Pose trajectories at 9 upper-body keypoints, including wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints, were sampled at 30 frames per second and estimated from 118 million video frames. In adherence with the FAIR data principles, we have shared AJILE12 on The Dandi Archive in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard and developed a browser-based dashboard to facilitate data exploration and reuse.

AB  - The head-direction (HD) system functions as a compass, with member neurons robustly increasing their firing rates when the animal's head points in a specific direction. HD neurons may be driven by peripheral sensors or, as computational models postulate, internally generated (attractor) mechanisms. We addressed the contributions of stimulus-driven and internally generated activity by recording ensembles of HD neurons in the antero-dorsal thalamic nucleus and the post-subiculum of mice by comparing their activity in various brain states. The temporal correlation structure of HD neurons was preserved during sleep, characterized by a 60°-wide correlated neuronal firing (activity packet), both within and across these two brain structures. During rapid eye movement sleep, the spontaneous drift of the activity packet was similar to that observed during waking and accelerated tenfold during slow-wave sleep. These findings demonstrate that peripheral inputs impinge on an internally organized network, which provides amplification and enhanced precision of the HD signal.

AB  - Hippocampal theta oscillations coordinate neuronal firing to support memory and spatial navigation. The medial septum (MS) is critical in theta generation by two possible mechanisms: either a unitary “pacemaker” timing signal is imposed on the hippocampal system, or it may assist in organizing target subcircuits within the phase space of theta oscillations. We used temperature manipulation of the MS to test these models. Cooling of the MS reduced both theta frequency and power and was associated with an enhanced incidence of errors in a spatial navigation task, but it did not affect spatial correlates of neurons. MS cooling decreased theta frequency oscillations of place cells and reduced distance-time compression but preserved distance-phase compression of place field sequences within the theta cycle. Thus, the septum is critical for sustaining precise theta phase coordination of cell assemblies in the hippocampal system, a mechanism needed for spatial memory.

AB  - The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication between the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of this process are unknown. We recorded neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a linear track, as well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated reactivations between the hippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked during hippocampal sharp wave–ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated during hippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus–BLA correlation patterns representing the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findings suggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation of hippocampus–amygdala circuits.

AB  - Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales, sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales, putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing pattern–dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets.

AB  - Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting. Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via endogenous oxytocin.

AB  - The relationship between mesoscopic local field potentials (LFPs) and single-neuron firing in the multi-layered neocortex is poorly understood. Simultaneous recordings from all layers in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the behaving mouse revealed functionally defined layers in V1. The depth of maximum spike power and sink-source distributions of LFPs provided consistent laminar landmarks across animals. Coherence of gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and spike-LFP coupling identified six physiological layers and further sublayers. Firing rates, burstiness, and other electrophysiological features of neurons displayed unique layer and brain state dependence. Spike transmission strength from layer 2/3 cells to layer 5 pyramidal cells and interneurons was stronger during waking compared with non-REM sleep but stronger during non-REM sleep among deep-layer excitatory neurons. A subset of deep-layer neurons was active exclusively in the DOWN state of non-REM sleep. These results bridge mesoscopic LFPs and single-neuron interactions with laminar structure in V1.

AB  - In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane anesthesia at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before and after ultrasound. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 different stimulation repetition frequencies (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that found following tetanic electrical stimulation. The fundamental frequency of ultrasound used was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset includes spike timing data from the recordings including time before and after ultrasound stimulation, for both true ultrasound conditions and sham ultrasound conditions in which ultrasound is directed off target.

AB  - The hippocampus constructs a map of the environment. How this “cognitive map” is utilized by other brain regions to guide behavior remains unexplored. To examine how neuronal firing patterns in the hippocampus are transmitted and transformed, we recorded neurons in its principal subcortical target, the lateral septum (LS). We observed that LS neurons carry reliable spatial information in the phase of action potentials, relative to hippocampal theta oscillations, while the firing rates of LS neurons remained uninformative. Furthermore, this spatial phase code had an anatomical microstructure within the LS and was bound to the hippocampal spatial code by synchronous gamma frequency cell assemblies. Using a data-driven model, we show that rate-independent spatial tuning arises through the dynamic weighting of CA1 and CA3 cell assemblies. Our findings demonstrate that transformation of the hippocampal spatial map depends on higher-order theta-dependent neuronal sequences.

UR  - https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000218/0.220131.1608
AB  - The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) have been studied extensively. Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120–180 Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly activated by SPW-Rs and may convey hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic and brainstem targets.

AB  - Touch perception depends on integrating signals from multiple types of peripheral mechanoreceptors. Merkel-cell associated afferents are thought to play a major role in form perception by encoding surface features of touched objects. However, activity of Merkel afferents during active touch has not been directly measured. Here, we show that Merkel and unidentified slowly adapting afferents in the whisker system of behaving mice respond to both self-motion and active touch. Touch responses were dominated by sensitivity to bending moment (torque) at the base of the whisker and its rate of change and largely explained by a simple mechanical model. Self-motion responses encoded whisker position within a whisk cycle (phase), not absolute whisker angle, and arose from stresses reflecting whisker inertia and activity of specific muscles. Thus, Merkel afferents send to the brain multiplexed information about whisker position and surface features, suggesting that proprioception and touch converge at the earliest neural level.

AB  - Mice adeptly use their whiskers to touch, recognize, and learn about objects in their environment. This behavior is enabled by computations performed by populations of neurons in the somatosensory cortex. To understand these computations, we trained mice to use their whiskers to recognize different shapes while we recorded activity in the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input. Here, we present a large dataset of high-speed video of the whiskers, along with rigorous tracking of the entire extent of multiple whiskers and every contact they made on the shape. We used spike sorting to identify individual neurons, which responded with precise timing to whisker contacts and motion. These data will be useful for understanding the behavioral strategies mice use to explore objects, as well as the neuronal dynamics that mediate those strategies. In addition, our carefully curated labeled data could be used to develop new computer vision algorithms for tracking body posture, or for extracting responses of individual neurons from large-scale neural recordings.

AB  - Flexible responses to sensory stimuli based on changing rules are critical for adapting to a dynamic environment. However, it remains unclear how the brain encodes and uses rule information to guide behavior. Here, we made single-unit recordings while head-fixed mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task where they switched between two rules: licking in response to tactile stimuli while rejecting visual stimuli, or vice versa. Along a cortical sensorimotor processing stream including the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, and the medial (MM) and anterolateral (ALM) motor areas, single-neuron activity distinguished between the two rules both prior to and in response to the tactile stimulus. We hypothesized that neural populations in these areas would show rule-dependent preparatory states, which would shape the subsequent sensory processing and behavior. This hypothesis was supported for the motor cortical areas (MM and ALM) by findings that (1) the current task rule could be decoded from pre-stimulus population activity; (2) neural subspaces containing the population activity differed between the two rules; and (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states impaired task performance. Our findings indicate that flexible action selection in response to sensory input can occur via configuration of preparatory states in the motor cortex.

AB  - The hippocampus has previously been implicated in both cognitive and endocrine functions. We simultaneously measured electrophysiological activity from the hippocampus and interstitial glucose concentrations in the body of freely behaving rats to identify an activity pattern that may link these disparate functions of the hippocampus. Here we report that clusters of sharp wave-ripples recorded from the hippocampus reliably predicted a decrease in peripheral glucose concentrations within about 10 min. This correlation was not dependent on circadian, ultradian or meal-triggered fluctuations, could be mimicked with optogenetically induced ripples in the hippocampus (but not in the parietal cortex) and was attenuated to chance levels by pharmacogenetically suppressing activity of the lateral septum, which is the major conduit between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. Our findings demonstrate that a function of the sharp wave-ripple is to modulate peripheral glucose homeostasis, and offer a mechanism for the link between sleep disruption and blood glucose dysregulation in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The brain generates complex sequences of movements that can be flexibly configured based on behavioural context or real-time sensory feedback, but how this occurs is not fully understood. Here we developed a ‘sequence licking’ task in which mice directed their tongue to a target that moved through a series of locations. Mice could rapidly branch the sequence online based on tactile feedback. Closed-loop optogenetics and electrophysiology revealed that the tongue and jaw regions of the primary somatosensory (S1TJ) and motor (M1TJ) cortices encoded and controlled tongue kinematics at the level of individual licks. By contrast, the tongue ‘premotor’ (anterolateral motor) cortex encoded latent variables including intended lick angle, sequence identity and progress towards the reward that marked successful sequence execution. Movement-nonspecific sequence branching signals occurred in the anterolateral motor cortex and M1TJ. Our results reveal a set of key cortical areas for flexible and context-informed sequence generation.

AB  - Much of sensory neuroscience has focused on how the brain faithfully represents sensory information. However, sensory information is often incomplete and ambiguous. Hence, the brain must rely on an internal model of the sensory world to infer a coherent percept. Illusions reveal rational mistakes in perceptual inference, yielding unique insights into the brain’s internal model. Here, we utilized illusory contours (ICs) to study the microcircuit mechanisms underlying the perceptual inference of an edge. Evidence for IC perception has been shown in multiple species, including mice. Neural correlates of IC perception have also been identified, i.e., neurons that respond to ICs with the same receptive field and feature selectivity (e.g., orientation tuning) as for real edges, despite the lack of feedforward sensory drive. Our goal was to investigate how neocortical microcircuits give rise to illusory responses in IC encoders. In addition, we aimed to investigate whether the microcircuit implementation of IC encoding is common across the visual cortex hierarchy.

AB  - Infant cries evoke powerful responses in parents. Whether parental animals are intrinsically sensitive to neonatal vocalizations, or instead learn about vocal cues for parenting responses is unclear. In mice, pup-naive virgin females do not recognize the meaning of pup distress calls, but retrieve isolated pups to the nest after having been co-housed with a mother and litte. Distress calls are variable, and require co-caring virgin mice to generalize across calls for reliable retrieval. Here we show that the onset of maternal behaviour in mice results from interactions between intrinsic mechanisms and experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory cortex. In maternal females, calls with inter-syllable intervals (ISIs) from 75 to 375 milliseconds elicited pup retrieval, and cortical responses were generalized across these ISIs. By contrast, naive virgins were neuronally and behaviourally sensitized to the most common (‘prototypical’) ISIs. Inhibitory and excitatory neural responses were initially mismatched in the cortex of naive mice, with untuned inhibition and overly narrow excitation. During co-housing experiments, excitatory responses broadened to represent a wider range of ISIs, whereas inhibitory tuning sharpened to form a perceptual boundary. We presented synthetic calls during co-housing and observed that neurobehavioural responses adjusted to match these statistics, a process that required cortical activity and the hypothalamic oxytocin system. Neuroplastic mechanisms therefore build on an intrinsic sensitivity in the mouse auditory cortex, and enable rapid plasticity for reliable parenting behaviour.

AB  - This dataset was collected for the Global Local Oddball project, as part of the Allen Institute's OpenScope project.
The brain rapidly adapts to unchanging environments and is most excited by surprising events. A leading model to explain this phenomenon is predictive coding. Predictive coding proposes that the brain compares incoming sensory information against a prediction signal. This prediction is based on an internal model that is generated in higher-order cortex. This model reflects the brain’s assumptions about the statistics of the environment. If an incoming sensory signal matches the prediction, the two signals cancel. Expected sensory data thus are “explained away” and leave the brain unexcited. In other words, predictive coding is subtractive. Whenever the sensory signal does not match the prediction, subtraction results in a larger value, called the prediction error. This error signal initiates excitation in the lower-order cortex that propagates feedforward up the cortical hierarchy (i.e., V1, RL, LM, AL, PM, and AM). Prediction errors then instigate updates to the internal model to improve future predictions. Associated prediction update signals flow back down the hierarchy. Consistent with this model, optogenetic silencing of top-down inputs from frontal to visual cortex largely eliminates prediction error signals. However, the precise circuit mechanisms that generate these signals are largely unknown. Specifically, by recording from multiple neuropixels across the visual cortical hierarchy, we aimed to uncover what information is carried by layer 2 and 3 spikes that feed forward vs. by layer 5 and 6 spikes that feed back, using recently established analytic tools.

AB  - Associated Reference Publication: Excitatory and inhibitory neural dynamics jointly tune motion detection
Neurons integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals to produce their outputs, but the role of input timing in this integration remains poorly understood. Motion detection is a paradigmatic example of this integration, since theories of motion detection rely on different delays in visual signals. These delays allow circuits to compare scenes at different times to calculate the direction and speed of motion. Different motion detection circuits have different velocity sensitivity, but it remains untested how the response dynamics of individual cell types drive this tuning. Here, we sped up or slowed down specific neuron types in Drosophila’s motion detection circuit by manipulating ion channel expression. Altering the dynamics of individual neuron types upstream of motion detectors increased their sensitivity to fast or slow visual motion, exposing distinct roles for excitatory and inhibitory dynamics in tuning directional signals, including a role for the amacrine cell CT1. A circuit model constrained by functional data and anatomy qualitatively reproduced the observed tuning changes. Overall, these results reveal how excitatory and inhibitory dynamics together tune a canonical circuit computation.

AB  - Spatial awareness is often intentional, arising from deliberate actions towards a target, while at other times it emerges from unexpected motion in the scene. To navigate the environment, animals must differentiate the spatial cues generated by self-motion from object movements that originate externally. To reveal the neural basis of this ability, we examined the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), which contains multiple egocentric maps of sensorimotor space. By simulating whisker-guided navigation through a dynamic landscape, we discovered a transient neural response that selectively emerged for unexpected, externally generated tactile motion. This transient response only emerged when external motion either gained or lost contact with a whisker, arguing that sensorimotor expectations are specific to a somatotopic location. When external motion sustained contact with the same whiskers, neurons shifted their spike timing to follow the dynamics of self-generated tactile features. Thus, representations based on the timing of self-generated cues may surpass the spatial acuity of the whisker array. In conclusion, the SC contains complementary rate and temporal codes to differentiate external from self-generated tactile features.

AB  - When a behavior repeatedly fails to achieve its goal, animals often give up and become passive, which can be strategic for preserving energy or regrouping between attempts. It is unknown how the brain identifies behavioral failures and mediates this behavioral-state switch. In larval zebrafish swimming in virtual reality, visual feedback can be withheld so that swim attempts fail to trigger expected visual flow. After tens of seconds of such motor futility, animals became passive for similar durations. Whole-brain calcium imaging revealed noradrenergic neurons that responded specifically to failed swim attempts and radial astrocytes whose calcium levels accumulated with increasing numbers of failed attempts. Using cell ablation and optogenetic or chemogenetic activation, we found that noradrenergic neurons progressively activated brainstem radial astrocytes, which then suppressed swimming. Thus, radial astrocytes perform a computation critical for behavior: they accumulate evidence that current actions are ineffective and consequently drive changes in behavioral states.

AB  - The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli. Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode arrays for brain–machine interfaces.

AB  - The light microscopic images were acquired from a cubic millimeter volume that spanned portions of primary visual cortex and three higher visual cortical areas. The volume was imaged in vivo by two-photon random access mesoscope (2P-RAM) from postnatal days P75 to P81 in a male mouse expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator in excitatory cells, while the mouse viewed natural movies and parametric stimuli. The calcium imaging data includes the single-cell responses of an estimated 75,000 pyramidal cells imaged over a volume of approximately 1200 x 1100 x 500 μm3 (anteroposterior x mediolateral x radial depth). The center of the volume was placed at the junction of primary visual cortex (VISp) and three higher visual areas, lateromedial area (VISlm), rostrolateral area (VISrl) and anterolateral area (VISal). During imaging, the animal was head-restrained, and the stimulus was presented to the left visual field. Treadmill rotation (single axis) and video of the animal's left eye were captured throughout the scan, yielding the locomotion velocity, eye movements, and pupil diameter data included here.

The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy (EM) data. The structural identifiers of the matched cells are added as plane segmentation columns extracted from the CAVE database. To access the latest revision see the notebook that is linked to this dandiset. The structural ids might not be present for all plane segmentations.

AB  - Time-lapse recordings for the investigation of the relationship between the electroporation efficiency of nsEP and changes in the transmembrane potential (TMP). A strobe imaging synchronized with nsEP exposure was used.  This allowed studying the nanosecond kinetics of TMP charging and relaxation, which is the primary effect of nsEP that rapidly charges the plasma membrane. The methodology involved pulsed laser fluorescence microscopy with voltage-sensitive FluoVolt dye-loaded cells that respond to TMP changes within nanoseconds. FluoVolt has a high sensitivity of about 10 % deltaF/F per 100 mV. During the imaging, a single short pulse laser flash is delivered at a precise time interval (addition of 25ns in each frame) before, during, or after nsEP exposure. The camera shutter opens in advance of and closes after the laser flash, capturing one TMP image per nsEP exposure. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258

AB  - Two-photon microscopy, combined with appropriate optical labeling, has enabled the study of structure and function throughout animals and their organ systems, especially nervous systems. This methodology enables, for example, the measurement and tracking of sub-micrometer structures within brain cells, the spatio-temporal mapping of spikes in individual neurons, and the spatio-temporal mapping of transmitter release in individual synapses. Yet the spatial resolution of two-photon microscopy rapidly degrades as imaging is attempted at depths more than a few scattering lengths into tissue, i.e., below the superficial layers that constitute the top 300 to 400 µm of neocortex. To obviate this limitation, we measure the wavefront of the guide star at the focus of the excitation beam and utilize adaptive optics that alters the incident wavefront to achieve an improved focal volume. We describe the construction, calibration, and operation of a two-photon microscope that incorporates adaptive optics to restore diffraction-limited resolution throughout the nearly 900 µm depth of mouse cortex. Our realization utilizes a guide star formed by excitation of red-shifted dye within the blood serum to directly measure the wavefront. We incorporate predominantly commercial optical, optomechanical, mechanical, and electronic components; computer aided design models of the exceptional custom components are supplied. The resultant adaptive-optics two-photon microscope is modular and allows for expanded imaging and optical excitation capabilities. We demonstrate our methodology in mouse neocortex by imaging the morphology of somatostatin-expressing neurons that lie 700 µm beneath the pia, calcium dynamics of layer 5b projection neurons, and thalamocortical glutamate transmission to L4 neurons.

AB  - In this set of experiments, we recorded neural signals using an electroencephalography (EEG) array and Neuropixels probes while directly electrically stimulating the cortex in awake and anesthetized head-fixed mice. Details of the experiments can be found in the associated manuscript (Claar, Rembado et al., 2023). Briefly, the recordings and stimulation commenced while the mouse was awake, free to rest or move on a rotating disc. After delivering a series of stimuli, anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (5% via inhalation). Once a surgical level of anesthesia was reached, the mouse was maintained unconscious (1-1.5% isoflurane) during the delivery of another series of stimuli. In some subjects another series of stimuli was delivered after the isoflurane was turned off, this epoch/state is referred to as “recovery” in the dataset.

Each session file includes the following data: raw EEG signals from all 30 surface electrodes and the associated electrode information; raw LFP signals from all electrodes on all Neuropixels probes (if used) and the associated electrode information; spike times for all units (spike sorted with Kilosort 2.0) that passed our quality threshold with associated information (brain region, spike waveform duration, etc.); subject’s speed computed from the rotation of the disc for the entire session; epochs marking when isoflurane was induced and when it was maintained; and a trial table containing information about every stimulus delivered throughout the session.

All sessions included an awake and an isoflurane epoch, but not all sessions included a recovery epoch. Some subjects received visual stimulation trials (visual stimuli presented on a screen in the subject’s right field of view) interleaved with the electrical stimulation trials.

AB  - This dataset contains recordings from PtNRGrids, which are devices designed to record electrocorticography (ECoG) activities from the brain surface at high-spatial resolution. PtNRGrids used here were a square-shaped array with 1024 channels and a 150-µm pitch, which was implanted to record neural activity from the entire right primary somatosensory barrel cortex. The sensory response on the brain was evoked by delivering air puffs through a microcapillary tube to individually stimulate individual whiskers on the contralateral side. This dataset demonstrates the high-spatial resolution recording capability of PtNRGrids isolate functional cortical columns in sub-mm resolution from the surface of the brain.

AB  - We present a dataset of 1809 single neurons  recorded from the human medial temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus) and medial frontal lobe (anterior cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, ventral medial prefrontal cortex) across 41 sessions from 21 patients that underwent intracranial monitoring for epileptic activity. Subjects first performed a screening task (907 neurons), based on which we identified images for which highly selective cells were present in the medial temporal lobe. Subjects then performed a working memory task (902 neurons), in which they were sequentially presented with 1-3 images, and following a maintenance period, were asked if a probe was identical to one of the currently maintained images. This Neural data without borders (NWB) formatted dataset includes spike times, extracellular spike waveforms, stimuli presented, behavior, electrode locations, and subject demographics. As validation, we replicate previous findings on the existence of concept cells and their persistent activity during working memory maintenance.  This dataset provides a substantial amount of rare human single neuron recordings together with behavior, thereby enabling investigation of the neural mechanisms of working memory at the single-neuron level.

AB  - This dataset was collected for the Predictive Coding project, as part of the Allen Institute for Brain Science's OpenScope project.

The experimental design involved visual stimulation with sequences of 4 natural scene images (ABCD) that are repeated many times, with an occasional rare oddball image in the 4th place in the sequence (ABCX). There are 10 unique oddball images which are each shown 10 times during the recording session. The main sequence (ABCD) is shown thousands of times. In addition to the oddball blocks there are control conditions where the 4 main sequence images and 10 oddball images are shown either entirely randomly, or where pairwise image transitions are maintained, but the overall sequence is shuffled (example pairs: AB, BC, CD, CX, XA, etc).

During this stimulus paradigm, 2-photon calcium imaging was used to record neural activity in three cortical areas (one area per recording session): the primary visual cortex, higher order visual area PM, and the retrosplenial cortex, across multiple cortical depths. During the recordings, mice were free to run on a circular disk and running speed was measured, along with pupil diameter and eye position. In each mouse, two of the three areas were imaged, and the third had a retrograde tracer (rAAV-mRuby2) injected to label inputs to that region. No differences in physiology were identified between retrogradely labeled and non-labeled neurons, thus this information was not included in the primary study of this dataset.

Results are provided in the form of normalized calcium traces (dF/F) for all recorded neurons, along with running speed, pupil measurements, and the timing of all stimulus events.

## Data Reading Instructions
The .nwb files can be viewed using PyNWB or MatNWB. To install and set up, please visit <https://www.nwb.org/how-to-use/>. Below, we show how to open and view an .nwb file using MatNWB.
### Loading the image data
```matlab
nwb = nwbRead(PATH_TO_NWB_FILE);

% first check what color channels are present
>> nwb.acquisition
ans =
  3×1 Set array with properties:
    TwoPhotonSeriesChanA: [types.core.TwoPhotonSeries]
    TwoPhotonSeriesChanB: [types.core.TwoPhotonSeries]
    TwoPhotonSeriesChanC: [types.core.TwoPhotonSeries]
```
The above code load the .nwb file and the output tells us that there are three channels present in the nwb file, which are ChanA, ChanB, and ChanC. Then, to load the actual data from a channel,
```matlab
% load the image data from ChanA
>> chanAdata = nwb.acquisition.get('TwoPhotonSeriesChanA').data.load();

% check its shape
>> size(chanAdata)
ans =
     1   512   512   181
```
### Loading the segmentation masks
For an overview of the mask for ChanA, for example,
```matlab
>> nwb.processing.get('ophys').nwbdatainterface.get('ImageSegmentation').planesegmentation.get('PlaneSegmentationChanA').image_mask.data
ans =
  DataStub with properties:
    filename: '.\sub-BPN-M4_ses-20210524-m1_obj-1c8nyxo_ophys.nwb'
        path: '/processing/ophys/ImageSegmentation/PlaneSegmentationChanA/image_mask'
        dims: [512 512 181]
       ndims: 3
    dataType: 'logical'
```
To load the actual mask data into array (may take several seconds to load),
```matlab
% load mask from ChanA
>> mask = nwb.processing.get('ophys').nwbdatainterface.get('ImageSegmentation').planesegmentation.get('PlaneSegmentationChanA').image_mask.data.load();

% check its shape
>> size(mask)
ans =
   512   512   181

AB  - This study investigates the effects of periodic sensory stimulation (PSS) on the activity of neurons of different types in the mouse visual cortex. The PSS modality used is the flickering light visual stimulation. The dataset provides calcium imaging data from VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide), SST (somatostatin), and PV (parvalbumin) expressing inhibitory neuron, as well as excitatory neurons in V1, in mice exposed to different visual stimulation conditions.

The visual stimulus is provided by an LED strip that is programmed for 4 conditions: 40 Hz flicker (gamma frequency), 8 Hz flicker (theta frequency), random frequency (light delivered with a random interval determined by a Poisson process with an average frequency of 40 Hz), and constant light on. Those conditions are reported in NWB file trial table. The LED strip was positioned in front of the mouse right eye in place of the visual stimulation screen used in (De Vries, Lecoq, Buice et al, Nature Neuroscience 2020). Light illumination started approximately 485 seconds into the experiment. The exact timing can be found in the stimulus table. Each mouse was recorded multiple times with individual cells matched. Each recording session only used one of the above stimulus conditions.

The data includes images from layers 2/3 and 5 (layer 4 instead of 5 for VIP) of the left visual cortex, capturing the contributions of superficial and deep cortical neurons to the network dynamics under visual PSS. The dataset was collected from 5 mice for SST, 6 mice for VIP, 2 mice for PV, and 2 mice for excitatory neurons. Mice were awake but not trained to perform any tasks. They were passively viewing the LED strip.  All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in compliance with NIH guidelines.

AB  - The incorporation of novel information into the hippocampal network is likely be constrained by its innate architecture and internally generated activity patterns. However, the origin, organization, and consequences of such patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we show that hippocampal network dynamics are affected by sequential neurogenesis. We birthdated CA1 pyramidal neurons with in-utero electroporation over 4 embryonic days encompassing the peak of hippocampal neurogenesis, and compared their functional features in freely moving, adult mice. Neurons of the same birthdate displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states, and assembly dynamics. Same birthdate hippocampal neurons were topographically organized, in that anatomically clustered (<500µm) neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations. Overall, the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination of birthdate and the rate of neurogenesis. These observations demonstrate that sequential neurogenesis in embryonic development shapes the preconfigured forms of adult network dynamics.

AB  - This dataset contains recordings from PtNRGrids, which are devices designed to record electrocorticography (ECoG) activities from the brain surface at high-spatial resolution. PtNRGrids used here were a square-shaped array with 1024 channels and a 150-µm pitch, which was implanted to record neural activity from the entire right primary somatosensory barrel cortex. The sensory response on the brain was evoked by delivering air puffs through a microcapillary tube to individually stimulate individual whiskers on the contralateral side. This dataset demonstrates the high-spatial resolution recording capability of PtNRGrids isolate functional cortical columns in sub-mm resolution from the surface of the brain.

AB  - Spontaneous animal behaviour is built from action modules that are concatenated by the brain into sequences. However, the neural mechanisms that guide the composition of naturalistic, self-motivated behaviour remain unknown. Here we show that dopamine systematically fluctuates in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express sub-second behavioural modules, despite the absence of task structure, sensory cues or exogenous reward. Photometric recordings and calibrated closed-loop optogenetic manipulations during open field behaviour demonstrate that DLS dopamine fluctuations increase sequence variation over seconds, reinforce the use of associated behavioural modules over minutes, and modulate the vigour with which modules are expressed, without directly influencing movement initiation or moment-to-moment kinematics. Although the reinforcing effects of optogenetic DLS dopamine manipulations vary across behavioural modules and individual mice, these differences are well predicted by observed variation in the relationships between endogenous dopamine and module use. Consistent with the possibility that DLS dopamine fluctuations act as a teaching signal, mice build sequences during exploration as if to maximize dopamine. Together, these findings suggest a model in which the same circuits and computations that govern action choices in structured tasks have a key role in sculpting the content of unconstrained, high-dimensional, spontaneous behavior.

AB  - Understanding how excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs are integrated by neurons requires monitoring their subthreshold behavior. We probed the subthreshold dynamics using optogenetic depolarizing pulses in hippocampal neuronal assemblies in freely moving mice. Excitability decreased during sharp- wave ripples coupled with increased I. In contrast to this “negative gain,” optogenetic probing showed increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable place fields in initially non–place cells. Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave ripples in the home cage predicted spatial overlap and sequences of place fields of both place cells and unmasked preexisting place fields of non–place cells during track running. Thus, indirect probing of subthreshold dynamics in neuronal populations permits the disclosing of preexisting assemblies and modes of neuronal operations.

AB  - We present an electrophysiological dataset recorded from nine subjects during a verbal working memory task. Subjects were epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. Subjects performed a modified Sternberg task in which the encoding of memory items, maintenance, and recall were temporally separated. The dataset includes simultaneously recorded scalp EEG with the 10-20 system, intracranial EEG (iEEG) recorded with depth electrodes, waveforms and spike times of 1526 units recorded in the medial temporal lobe, and the MNI coordinates and anatomical labels of all intracranial electrodes. Subject characteristics and information on sessions (set size, match/mismatch, correct/incorrect, response, response time for each trial) are also provided. This dataset enables the investigation of working memory by providing simultaneous scalp EEG and iEEG recordings, which can be used for connectivity analysis, alongside hard to obtain unit recordings from humans.

AB  - We present an electrophysiological dataset recorded from thirteen subjects during a visual working memory task. Subjects were epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. Here, we recorded single neuron firing in 13 epilepsy patients (7 male) while they performed a visual working memory task. The task is a change detection task designed to examine the visual working memory of subjects. In each trial, arrays of colored squares were presented and had to be memorized. The number of squares determined the set size: 1, 2, 4 or 6. There was a total 192 trials per session. Each trial started with a warning signal (0.4 s) that was a red fixation dot. The fixation dot was then changed to black (0.4 – 0.5 s, jittered). A memory array (encoding period, 0.8 s) was followed by a delay (retention interval, 0.9 s). After the delay, a test array was shown (2 s) followed by a jittered inter-trial interval of 1.3 to 2.3 s. The participants indicated by button press (“Same” or “Different”, forced choice) whether the test array differed from the memory array. If the arrays differed, only one square changed in colour, but all squares remained on the same location. The fixation dot was visible on the screen during the whole trial period. Eight different colours were used for the memory and test array (yellow, red, green, blue, magenta, cyan, grey, black). Before starting the sessions, participants conducted trial runs in a practice session to learn the task. In this session we verified if participants were colour-blind and could discriminate all colours. Practice sessions were repeated until the participant understood the task and was able to follow the pace of the trials.

AB  - We present an electrophysiological dataset collected from the amygdalae of nine subjects attending a visual dynamic stimulation of emotional aversive content. The subjects were patients affected by epilepsy who underwent preoperative invasive monitoring in the mesial temporal lobe. Subjects were presented with dynamic visual sequences of fearful faces (aversive condition), interleaved with sequences of neutral landscapes (neutral condition).

We provide simultaneous recordings of intracranial EEG (iEEG) and neuronal spike times and waveforms, and metadata related to the task, subjects, sessions and electrodes in the NIX standard. We technically validated this dataset and provide here the spike sorting quality metrics and the spectra of iEEG signals.
This dataset allows the investigation of amygdalar response to dynamic aversive stimuli at multiple spatial scales, from the macroscopic EEG to the neuronal firing in the human brain.

AB  - This is the dataset for Tseng et al, "Shared and specialized coding across posterior cortical areas for dynamic navigation decisions" in Neuron (2022). The dataset contains calcium activity of >200,000 neurons recorded from 6 different cortical areas in mouse posterior cortex L2/3 and L5 using two-photon imaging, including V1 and secondary visual areas, retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while the mice were performing a flexible decision-making task based on rule-switching during virtual navigation. There are total 300 behavior + imaging sessions collected from 8 mice. The neurons in each experiment have been registered into the Allen Institute Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) based on widefield retinotopy. In addition, these neurons contain fluorescent labels of retroAAV injected in one of the two sets of projection targets: an anterior part of anterior cingulate cortex/secondary motor cortex (ACC/M2) and striatum, or a posterior part of ACC/M2 and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).

AB  - We present a multimodal dataset of intracranial recordings, fMRI, and eye tracking in 20 human participants. Intracranial recordings consist of single neurons, local field potential, and intracranial EEG activity recorded concurrently from depth electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial frontal cortex while participants underwent intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. Participants watched an 8-min long movie ("Bang You're Dead") and performed a recognition memory test for movie content. 3T fMRI activity was recorded prior to surgery in 11 of the same participants while performing the same task. This NWB- and BIDS-formatted dataset includes the spike times of all neurons, field potential activity, behavior, eye tracking, electrode locations, demographics, and functional and structural MRI scans. For technical validation, we provide signal quality metrics, assess eye tracking quality, behavior, the tuning of cells and high-frequency broadband power field potentials to familiarity and event boundaries, and show brain-wide inter-subject correlations. This dataset will facilitate the investigation of brain activity during movie watching, recognition memory, and the neural basis of the fMRI-BOLD signal.

T1  - Effect of the electric field vector change on the electroporation efficiency of paired-pulse trains compared to single-pulse trains
AU  - Kim, Vitalii
DO  - 10.48324/DANDI.000631/0.231012.1508
UR  - https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000631/0.231012.1508
AB  - In the study, the impact of varying the electric field vector on the effectiveness of electroporation was examined, utilizing both paired-pulse trains, consisting of 5 pulses at 600 + 600 ns, and single-pulse trains with 5 pulses at 600 ns. These were applied to a BPAE cell monolayer at frequencies of either 1 Hz or 833 kHz. The focus was on assessing the alterations in electroporation efficiency, gauged through the changes in YoPro-1 emission when compared to the baseline established by a single-pulse train in the identical region of interest, which was set at 100%. The evaluation criteria included the angle at which the electric field vector direction alternated between two pulses within a pair. Introduction of pulses in pairs amplified the electroporation efficiency at smaller angles but resulted in an inhibition at larger angles, indicating a frequency-dependent relationship. The images captured during the experiments provided a comprehensive visualization of this effect, highlighting the nuanced impact of electric field vector modifications on electroporation efficiency.

AB  - The efficiency of electroporation was evaluated in an experiment involving co-directional and cross-directional paired pulses using a triangular electrode array. BPAE cell monolayers were exposed to trains of four paired pulses, each consisting of 600 + 600 ns, at two distinct frequencies: 1 Hz and 770 kHz, with an amplitude of 10 kV/cm. In one scenario, the electric field direction remained consistent throughout each pair (co-directional). In another, the field direction was altered by 90° (cross-directional). The electroporation efficiency was quantified through the cells’ uptake of YoPro-1 dye, serving as a measure of the permeabilization of the cell membranes under varying electric field orientations and frequencies.

AB  - Strobe photography, used at nanosecond resolution, captures the dynamic process of cell membrane charging and relaxation kinetics in cells treated with FluoVolt dye and exposed to electric pulses. This study uses a triangular electrode array where 300 ns pulses are applied alternately at a frequency of 1.67 MHz. The precise coordination of electric pulses and laser flashes, adjusted in 50 ns steps, allows for the detailed imaging of the cell's response. The electric field induces enhanced fluorescence at the cathode-facing side of the FluoVolt-loaded CHO cells and suppressed fluorescence at the anode-facing side. This research method provides a comprehensive and reliable examination of the cell membrane's behavior under electrical stimulation without causing damage, ensuring consistent observations to understand cellular responses to varying electrical stimuli.

AB  - Male Long Evans Rats 7-12 months of age. 24 total animals. 256 sessions.  13 animals received a frontal traumatic brain injury (controlled cortical impact). 11 animals received Sham (no craniotomy no TBI) conditions. One week later, rats underwent a second surgery to implant 32 electrodes (Francoeur et al., Front. Psychiatry, 2021). Rats were trained to perform a self-paced probabilistic reversal learning task in a custom operant box with five noseports, stepper-motors to deliver water reward, houselight, and auditory tones. Local field potential (LFP) streams recorded simultaneously from 32 Brain Regions - recorded using a 32-Channel RHD headstage coupled to a RHD USB interface board (Intan Technologies). Open Ephys software at 1KHz band-pass filter set at 0.3-999Hz during acquisition. Lab-streaming-layer (LSL) was used to integrate physiology data with behavior. Physiology can be time-locked to trial onset (rat responds to start trial), response (rat choice between noseports), reward (time of reward delivery)

AB  - Retaining information in working memory (WM) is a demanding process that relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity from interference. How cognitive control regulates WM storage, however, remains unknown. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent activity are coordinated by theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in WM. In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of WM load and quality. We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity representations of WM content that were associated with improved behavior. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of WM, with frontal control managing maintenance of WM content in storage-related areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control and WM storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.

AB  - Walking is a fundamental mode of locomotion, yet its neural correlates are unknown at brain-wide scale in any animal. We use volumetric two-photon imaging to map neural activity associated with walking across the entire brain of Drosophila. We detect locomotor signals in approximately 40% of the brain, identify a global signal associated with the transition from rest to walking, and define clustered neural signals selectively associated with changes in forward or angular velocity. These networks span functionally diverse brain regions, and include regions that have not been previously linked to locomotion. We also identify time-varying trajectories of neural activity that anticipate future movements, and that represent sequential engagement of clusters of neurons with different behavioral selectivity. These motor maps suggest a dynamical systems framework for constructing walking maneuvers reminiscent of models of forelimb reaching in primates and set a foundation for understanding how local circuits interact across large-scale networks.

HEK 923 cells were cultured on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-coated coverslips and loaded with the Cal520 fluorescent indicator for visualization. Real-time imaging was performed in Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent (TIRF) mode. Electrophysiological manipulations were applied using a patch clamp in voltage clamp mode, set in a whole-cell configuration. The protocol included a command voltage of 0 mV interrupted by a -50 mV pulse for 50 ms and a -400 mV pulse for 1 ms at frame 91, returning to -50 mV for 50 ms. Additionally, 0.4 seconds into the second and third stacks, the command voltage was changed from 0 mV to -50 mV for 50 ms. The study was supported in part by NIH 15R21EY034803 and NIH 1R21EY034258.

T1  - FALCON Benchmark M1-A: primary motor cortex recordings in primate during reach-to-grasp task

UR  - https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000941/0.241029.1405
AB  - This dataset contains multiunit spiking times and behavioral data from a macaque performing a reach-to-grasp task. The experimental task was a center-out reaching task with four different objects in eight possible positions. Neural activity was recorded from electrode arrays implanted in primary motor cortex (M1). Electromyographical (EMG) activity was simultaneously recorded from upper limb muscles. Provided as part of the FALCON Benchmark: https://snel-repo.github.io/falcon/

The datafile contains the following data in the acquisition fields: `preprocessed_emg` containing iEMG recordings from 16 muscles and `eval_mask` indicating within-trial periods used for evaluating performance in the FALCON Benchmark. Each datafile also includes spike times in the `units` field, and trial metadata for each reach and grasp (`gocue_time`, `move_onset_time`, `contact_time`, `reward_time`, `result`, `number`, `tgt_loc`, `tgt_obj`, `obj_id`, `condition_id`) in the `trials` field.

As part of the FALCON challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The `held-in-calib` data includes many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON challenge. The `held-in-minival` data is a small subset of the `held-in-calib` data intended for FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, `held-out-calib` data are separate sessions of data from `held-in-calib`, but have much fewer trials, intended to be used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors if making use of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each dataset split is considered one "subject" by the DANDI repository; only data from one monkey is included.

Data from an additional monkey is available here: https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001209

AB  - This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from from multiple brain areas,  including globus pallidus-internus (GPi), ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VLa and VLp) and the arm-related regions of primary motor cortex, including sulcus (M1-S) and gyrus (M1-G) subregions, in monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task. Small numbers of recordings were also obtained from supplementary motor area (SMA), external globus pallidus (GPe), the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN), striatum (STR) and the region between RTN and VL thalamus (R-V). It contains data from two monkeys before and after the administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), which induces Parkinsonism. The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon) or glass-insulated tungsten microelectrodes (0.5–1.5 MΩ, Alpha Omega). The neuronal data were amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and digitized at 24.414 kHz (approx., 16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies). The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded, and candidate action potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon or custom algorithm, TomSort, https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11176978).

The recordings for subject Isis before the administration of MPTP (pre-MPTP) were collected by Daisuke Kase.
The recordings for subject Isis after the administration of MPTP (post-MPTP) were collected by Yan Han (韩妍).
The recordings for subject Gaia (pre-MPTP,  post-MPTP) from 2015 were collected by Andrew J. Zimnik.

AB  - The dataset contains neural activity from participant T5, who gave informed consent and was enrolled in the BrainGate2 Neural Interface System clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00912041, registered June 3, 2009). This pilot clinical trial was approved under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) by the US Food and Drug Administration (Investigational Device Exemption #G090003). Permission was also granted by the Institutional Review Boards of Stanford University (protocol #20804). Data was recorded from two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays in the hand "knob" area of of T5's left hemisphere precentral gyrus. On each trial, T5 was prompted to copy a cued sentence by writing individual characters, separated by a ">" space character. Decoded letters appeared on the screen below the prompt.

In each datafile, the `acquisitions` field contains `binned_spikes` (binned at 20ms) and the `eval_mask` used for determining valid FALCON evaluation periods.

AB  - Compulsive behavior is a defining feature of disorders such as substance use disorders. Current evidence
suggests that corticostriatal circuits control the expression of established compulsions, but little is known
about the mechanisms regulating the development of compulsions. We hypothesized that dopamine, a critical modulator of striatal synaptic plasticity, could control alterations in corticostriatal circuits leading to the
development of compulsions (defined here as continued reward seeking in the face of punishment). We used
dual-site fiber photometry to measure dopamine axon activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as compulsions emerged. Individual variability in the speed with which compulsions emerged was predicted by DMS dopamine axon activity. Amplifying this dopamine signal accelerated
animals’ transitions to compulsion, whereas inhibition delayed it. In contrast, amplifying DLS dopamine
signaling had no effect on the emergence of compulsions. These results establish DMS dopamine signaling
as a key controller of the development of compulsive reward seeking.

AB  - Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however, whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine neuron subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect dopaminergic functions.

AB  - We provided a long-term brain electrophysiological dataset of 15 pilocarpine-treated temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) rats during the development of epilepsy. The dataset was constituted by multi-site local field potential (LFP) signal recorded from 12 sites in the circuit of Papez in TLE, including spontaneous seizures and interictal fragments in the chronic period. The LFP data were saved in MATLAB, stored as the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, and published on the DANDI Archive. The dataset can be used to evaluate the alterations of seizure onset zone (SOZ), seizure onset pattern (SOP), and functional network connectivity during the development of epilepsy. We have technically validated the dataset through histology and specific signal analysis. In addition, we provided MATLAB codes for basic analyses of this dataset, including power spectral analysis, SOP identification, and interictal spike detection. The dataset is available to reveal how brain electrophysiological and epileptic network properties of chronic TLE rats change from early to late stages, and help inform the design of adaptive neuromodulation for epilepsy.

Compared to the same protocol delivered at a 1 Hz frequency, the MHz compression significantly reduced the cell ablation area near the electrodes while maintaining the same level of effect at the center. The experimental setup utilized a four-electrode array. For cell permeabilization evaluation, YoPro-1 was used, and to assess cell death two hours post-protocol delivery, Propidium Iodide was used.

Establishing how neural function emerges from network properties is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Here, to better understand the relationship between the structure and the function of a nervous system, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,433 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from model predictions that are based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle-dependent signalling, including on timescales of less than a second, that evoke acute calcium transients—often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that, in such cases, extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function to that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts the neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than do models based on anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signalling drive neural dynamics on short timescales, and that measurements of evoked signal propagation are crucial for interpreting neural function.

AB  - Neural population dynamics relevant to behavior vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales across three-dimensional volumes. Current optical approaches lack the spatial coverage and resolution necessary to measure and manipulate naturally occurring patterns of large-scale, distributed dynamics within and across deep brain regions such as the striatum. We designed a new micro-fiber array approach capable of chronically measuring and optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and freely moving mice, enabling the investigation of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific signals over arbitrary 3D volumes at a spatial resolution and coverage previously inaccessible. We applied this method to resolve rapid dopamine release dynamics across the striatum, revealing distinct, modality-specific spatiotemporal patterns in response to salient sensory stimuli extending over millimeters of tissue.

Abstract:
Working Memory (WM) and Long-Term Memory (LTM) are often viewed as separate cognitive  systems.  Little  is  known  about  how  these  systems  interact  when  forming memories. We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while patients maintained novel items in WM and a subsequent recognition memory test for the same items. In the hippocampus but not the amygdala, the level of WM content-selective persist activity during WM maintenance was predictive of whether the item was later recognized with high confidence or forgotten. In contrast, visually evoked activity in the same cells was not predictive of LTM formation. During LTM retrieval, memory-selective neurons responded more strongly to familiar stimuli for which persistent activity was high while they were maintained in WM. Our study suggests that hippocampal persistent activity of the same cell supports both WM maintenance and LTM encoding, thereby revealing a common single-neuron component of these two memory systems.

AB  - We provided a comprehensive dataset from a study involving 4-channel long-term brain electrophysiological recordings from 7 pilocarpine-treated rats, each subjected to 4 baseline and 4 stimulation groups. Each group was monitored over a period of 5 to 10 days, with a minimum of 6 spontaneous seizures recorded. The baseline groups captured spontaneous seizures without therapeutic stimulation, while the stimulation groups included spontaneous seizures with therapeutic intervention. Stimulation targets were randomly assigned and not repeated across groups, ensuring independent assessments of treatment effects. The LFP data were saved in MATLAB, adhering to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, and are available on the DANDI Archive. This dataset facilitates the evaluation of brain network dynamics and the effects of different stimulation targets on individual responses throughout the study, highlighting the varying effects of stimulation across different individuals.
