From an email correspondence:\n\n\u003e    As I told in slack, the upload succeeded by running :\n\u003e    'set DANDI_DEVEL=1', then 'dandi -l DEBUG upload --devel-debug'\n\u003e    The later trials for 'dandi -l DEBUG upload --J 1:1' and 'dandi -l DEBUG\n\u003e    upload --J 1:5' worked, \n\u003e    'dandi -l DEBUG upload --J 5:1' and 'dandi -l DEBUG upload --J 5:5' got\n\u003e    stuck.\n\u003e    As Yarik mentioned, the default uploading is 5 files at the same time-- 5\n\u003e    treads in parallel. So, I guess the reason I failed in previous uploading\n\u003e    is it can't deal multiple files at the same time. \n\nand processes were stuck in `pre-validating` state.  Might be something about caching by fscacher or locking... heh","files":null}]}
