I don't think we have to generally mandate (ie error out) if client version is not the most recent - new version might not only be fixing but also could introduce bugs, and trying to address one issue people might introduce another. Also this would entirely prevent inclusion into stable distributions.\nWe do announce minimal compatible version in archive api and some times do boost it up.\n\nWe announce availability of new version on top of run, but it gets lost in the terminal output.\n\nTo improve feedback to the user, if any upload fails - exit with non-O. If existing with non-0, check version again - if newer one available - add warning level message suggesting to update since might potentially address the issue. It will be suggestive.\n\nAlso if validation fails during upload - log warning to check the log (may be hint which line to look for) for details.","files":null}]}
