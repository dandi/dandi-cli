But complimentary to that I think it would benefit us and DANDI users to know what extensions are contained in any given nwb file, e.g. ATM I would like to know which dandisets in the archive have nwb files **without** extensions so I have a better chance to have them load.\nWe already have an ad-hoc way to detect and autoload some (https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/ea86eeee974fc58fac03b0af86cf606baba06e97/dandi/metadata.py#L68) which could provide a starting point.  I guess it should be an additional entry within `asset.wasGeneratedBy` which would list the extension and its version.  Right @satra?\n\n@bendichter is there a better than our ad-hoc way to identify if file \"has extensions\" in it? (I asked a related question in https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/1337 but it might actually be even pertinent to nwb-schema itself)","files":null}]}
