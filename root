Ideally all that information should come from a fixture.\n\nI also wonder if we could may be make a \"test level\" fixture which would use the \"session level local_docker_compose\" fixture so it could also make any test specific changes, such as  `monkeypatch.setenv(\"DANDI_API_KEY\", local_docker_compose[\"api_key\"])`?\n\nAll that to possibly make fixture replaceable or used (later) in parametrization of the test, and to avoid duplicate code within tests using the fixture.","files":null}]}
