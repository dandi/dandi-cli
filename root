I am not sure if there is some native pytest way to announce scope outside of `session`, it does seems to allow to change scope dynamically (https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html#dynamic-scope) but not sure if would help here.  so may be there could be some env var (e.g. DANDI_TESTS_PERSIST_DOCKER_COMPOSE=1|0) which if defined at all would instruct to first check if may be there is already a running instance and thus avoid `docker-compose up` while also not doing `docker-compose down` upon teardown unless == `0`; or choose other/better values than 1 and 0)","files":null}]}
