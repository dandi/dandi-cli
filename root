Rationale:\n\n- dandi-cli depends on heavy h5py/hdmf/libhdf5 - complicates considering it for use by dandi-api which wouldn't need those\n- we do not have a clean path toward staging metadata schema for a release -- we always release from master as soon as it gets a new version\n\nSo the decision was made to split away all the metadata schema (pydantic models, validation of them) into `dandischema`.  All metadata extraction/harmonization from files (nwb and later bids etc) will remain in dandi-cli, but we would validate using functionality moved to `dandischema`.\n\nAttn @satra , @jwodder (not yet assigning since we probably want to have #596 merged first or WDYT?)","files":null}]}
