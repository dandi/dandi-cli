What is your `dandi upload` invocation ?\n\nas I noted in https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/issues/298 it seems that we have changes to many (or all, didn't check) assets in 000108 whenever there is really no changes to zarr content or associated metadata, besides a new `urn:uuid` for metadata generation.  @jwodder could you please double check that we are not somehow causing minting a new asset upon reupload of a zarr which has nothing changed etc.","files":null}]}
