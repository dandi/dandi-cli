Currently to validate and upload video files we need to specify the option `allow-any-path`. Since we now explicitly organize video files with `dandi organise` I think we should not need this option as the user may be able to upload other unwanted files along with videos. Additionally, for this option to work the `DANDI_DEVEL` env variable needs to exist so any user would need to do: `DANDI_DEVEL=1 dandi validate --allow-any-path`. This is rather un-user-friendly for common users. \n2. Need to validate video files:\n- Currently we support the organization of `\".mp4\", \".avi\", \".wmv\", \".mov\", \".flv\"` formats. Validation could enforce these extensions. While this list of file containers are only a start, we will build a better list once things get rolling and we encounter different video formats used in animal experiments. \n- It is theoretically possible for acquisition systems to output corrupted videos: have dropped frames, no frames. Ideally its the users responsibility to correct this. This could be checked by opening the file using opencv within a `try/except` block. I am not sure if this happens often enough to make it a necessary check everytime.","files":null}]}
