I expressed similar desires for more \"interactive\" within datalad, but somewhat agree (with Kyle) that for commands which by default are expected to be non-interactive, behavior should be explicitly described (e.g. download latest released version if no version specified), and only with explicit `--interactive|-i` they should offer choices.  Similar to what `git` does.  We aren't git here, but we do expect `dandi` to be used in CIs etc.\n\n_Originally posted by @yarikoptic in https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/134#issuecomment-669498120_","files":null}]}
