As @CodyCBakerPhD mentions in https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/941/files#r830671373 , nwbinspector provides more informative result records with contextual information about the error etc.\n\nSimilarly for BIDS validation being added in #896 error messages are also serialized/simplified, although stock `bids-validator` has quite an extensive registry of warnings/errors: [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/181vtw2bt2nHcUgw__G_gFSkKGyuxOxUNr5wHrZXY_uI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nLooking forward we should establish a ValidationResult data type/class/record which would be expressive to cover validation results from various validators.  I foresee it to also reflect the \"source\" of the validation result, so overall should have (more to be filled out later on; yet to look at what nwbinspector provides):\n\n- origin: what produced this validation result\n  - `name: str` , e.g. `\"nwbinspector\"`\n  - `version: str` -- version of the tool producing the result, e.g. `\"0.3.1\"`\n- `severity: {'ERROR', 'WARNING', 'HINT'}`  -- for now just reflecting \n- `id: str` (or `id: list`?) -- identifier of that particular type of result. For BIDS could be its Key or numeric ID. Providing a unique string ID like BIDS does quite nice since gives immediate summary in its name \n- `scope: {'file', 'dandiset'}` -- either it is\n- `path: str` - path to file or folder/dandiset which triggered the error\n- `message: str` - it would be the \"Reason\" of BIDS or a string interpolation of nwbinspector record?","files":null}]}
