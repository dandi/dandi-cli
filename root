Then @satra envisions that `dandi` (during `organize` and/or `upload`) somehow (an exact algorithmic procedure was not yet formulated) would use assets metadata from archive to ensure \"correct\" disambiguation.\n\nHaving (only briefly) thought about it, I am not yet sure about possibility of a clean algorithmic procedure which would satisfy us.  I think that we might \"alternatively\" make it more explicit by\n\n- addressing https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/69\n- which in turn likely address https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues/1000\n\nand would allow user to explicitly state for a given dandiset which metadata entities to use, and thus make any *partial dandiset organize* be consistent with the case if it was done on an entire dandiset across all files.
