When uploading a new or edited JSON file that accompanies a Zarr file in a BIDS inspired dataset, the JSON file does not get recognized by the `dandi upload` command when the `dataset_description.json` file is missing at the top-level directory of the Dandiset.  Do you know why this might be the case?\n2. The `dataset_description.json` file is required for a BIDS dataset (see [BIDS Specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-agnostic-files.html#dataset-description)), but we don't specify that this is a requirement for a Dandiset.\n\nThank you.\n\ncc @dstansby @aaronkanzer","files":null}]}
