The only 2 differences that exist between `dandi-cli` and `linc-cli` are:\n\n• `client.dandi_authenticate()` is called upon every command in `linc-cli` due to the locked-down nature of LINC assets for now\n• LINC has an API Key called `LINCBRAIN_API_KEY`\n\nThere are no other differences, other than the API that is hit of course (`api.lincbrain.org/.....`)\n\nMy proposal here would be to:\n\n1. Expand the `DandiInstance` object offerings to include `LINC` in `consts.py` -- [code reference](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/6aa414c4db47394970f586cc4fb9758a634aef87/dandi/consts.py#L119-L135)\n2. Add a `is_private_data` boolean to the `DandiInstance` -- [code reference](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/blob/6aa414c4db47394970f586cc4fb9758a634aef87/dandi/consts.py#L99). This bool value would be used to decide upon what commands in `dandi-cli` would require `client.dandi_authenticate()`\n3. Include an `--api-key` flag that could be passed in the CLI commands to handle the API key for any extending instance (would go against the `keyring` pattern a bit, so curious to get your thoughts especially here)\n\nLet me know -- I'll default to some of your wisdom here as you've authored most of the CLI tool\n\nCc @waxlamp -- tagging for visibility for Kitware folks","files":null}]}
