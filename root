For this, I often need to download only a subset of a full dataset.\n\nI would like to suggest the following feature: to enable users to identify a subset of files they want to download from a dataset using either the subject name or a matching string. This can already be done manually by the user by retrieving a list of assets for a dataset, getting their paths and identifying the assets with the matching string, e.g. \"sub-123\". \n\nWould it be useful to integrate such a functionality into the repo, either directly in `download()` from `download.py` or into a separate function that retrieves urls for download?","files":null}]}
