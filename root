In my view, one that is rather urgent, derives from the following problem: When a dataset-related paper is published, it should typically be added to the dandiset's related resources. Updating the dandiset metadata requires a new dandiset version to be generated with its own DOI. Release notes would allow dandiset owners to clarify that only minor metadata differences exist between the dandiset version _the paper points to_, and the dandiset version _that points to the paper_. I think this could be very important to avoid confusion for end users.","files":null}]}
