The recommended replacement for `distutils.version` is [`packaging.version`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html); however, its equivalent(?) of `LooseVersion`, [`LegacyVersion`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version.html#packaging.version.LegacyVersion), is also deprecated.  Finding the proper version class to use depends on just how pynwb versions are structured.\n\n@yarikoptic What do we know about the format of pynwb versions?","files":null}]}
