That said, since there may be future uploads with the same organism, it would probably be a good idea to get the species added to the ones that DANDI supports.\n\u003e \n\u003e Can you help get this species added? Once it is, please let me know as I'd like to re-upload the NWB files so that the `species` field in the NWBs remain `Macaca nemestrina` instead of the NCBITaxon URL that I used to get the uploads to work.\n\u003e \n\u003e Many thanks for your help!\n\u003e \n\u003e Best,\n\u003e \n\u003e Nicholas Mei","files":null}]}
