E.g. while being within some specific study (already known to DANDI) I could simply `dandi upload FILES*` without worrying to map them \"properly\" to some collection/folder on DANDI (girder) server.\n\nSo we need to decide on organization of datasets on Girder and locally.\n\n## On Girder\n\nThere are \n- collections\n- folders\n\nIt is not clear to me yet on either we should define a \"Collection\" per each dataset or just rely on some flat or non-flat hierarchy within a specific (e.g. per center/study) collection to upload datasets.\n\n##  Locally\n\nNot unlike git (with `.git`) we could define/rely on `.dandi/` folder to define the dataset boundary. Such folder could contain necessary configuration/credentials etc to interoperate with DANDI archive, while user is within that directory or under any of its subdirectories.","files":null}]}
