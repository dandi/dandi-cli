It would be nice if the enum had aliases ([members with different names but the same value](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#duplicating-enum-members-and-values)) allowing the use of more common names of digest algorithms as alternatives to the canonical names — for example, allowing `DigestType.SHA1` as an alias for `DigestType.sha1` and allowing `DigestType.sha256` \u0026 `DigestType.SHA256` as aliases for `DigestType.sha2_256`.\n\n@satra How would we do this without messing up the JSON Schema \u0026 JSON-LD stuff?","files":null}]}
