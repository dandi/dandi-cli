But we have `delete` not `rm`. We do have `ls` and not `list`. \n\nSo we have mixing of concise abbreviated (`ls` and `mv`) and verbose (`delete` not `rm`, `download` not some `get`). For consistency may be we should get to one flavor.  As much as like concise, I think we better go with verbose and rename `ls` into `list` and any new command should also stay verbose. WDYT @dandi/dandi-cli  -- allow for some concise (`rm`, `mv`, `ls`) or make them all verbose (`delete`, `move`, `list`)?","files":null}]}
