This may be an impedance mismatch between a pure rdf and an owl data model. Thoughts?\n\nedit: similar issue with RelationType, modelling data vs modelling the entities in the world. It seems that the `dandi:` space is modelling the structure of the data and that we would have to lift those ids to the class level to get an owl representation?","files":null}]}
