Fortunately, there are two major projects that can help out in different ways (using one or the other, not both):\n\n* [`flake8-import-order`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order) — a plugin for flake8 that, if used, would cause the linter to fail if any imports are out of order\n    * The plugin supports a variety of import order styles.  I would recommend either the `appnexus` style or [my custom `jwodder` style](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-import-order-jwodder/).\n* [`isort`](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) — a program that can be added to the pre-commit configuration to automatically edit source files to put `import` statements in a reasonable order.\n    * I recommend the following configuration for isort:\n\n            profile = \"black\"\n            multi_line_output = 6  # Unless black doesn't like this?\n            force_sort_within_sections = true","files":null}]}
