That PR adds a good number of explicit `title` entries even when they could be trivially created, e.g. `title=\"Value Reference\"` for `valueReference` at https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pull/299/files#diff-295856c56542fa0dda691f493995baed932f49e94744fbacfbd7412db8c79f17R135\n\nSo we should remove hardcoded \"duplicate\" entries and produce title for all entries where no explicit one is defined, so all UIs could consistently display them","files":null}]}
