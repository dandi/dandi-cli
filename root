So likely it is a version of yaml and/or parameters to it.  We need `dandi wtf` (hence new #57).  \n\non bad host:\n```\nsmaug:/mnt/datasets/dandi\n$\u003e welp yaml\nPATH       : /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/__init__.py\nSRC PATH   : /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/__init__.py\nVERSION    : Not found\n__version__: '3.13'\nPACKAGE    : python3-yaml\nii  python3-yaml   3.13-2       amd64        YAML parser and emitter for Python3\n```\non good:\n```\n$\u003e welp yaml   \nPATH       : /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/__init__.py\nSRC PATH   : /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/yaml/__init__.py\nVERSION    : Not found\n__version__: '5.3'\nPACKAGE    : python3-yaml\nii  python3-yaml   5.3-1        amd64        YAML parser and emitter for Python3\npython3-yaml:\n  Installed: 5.3-1\n  Candidate: 5.3-2\n  Version table:\n     5.3-2 900\n        900 http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye/main amd64 Packages\n        600 http://http.debian.net/debian sid/main amd64 Packages\n *** 5.3-1 100\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n```\n\nI feel that I had such issue somewhere but now it is too late to try to remember on how to overcome.","files":null}]}
