Then (if pynwb/hdmf can take those as well, may be already does) analytics code could just use `Dandiset` abstraction to ask for a location (local `file://` or e.g. url on s3 for ros3) and interact with  the asset without needing any change to analytics code, and just by swapping which Dandiset (local or remote) it would use.\n\nWDYT @satra @jwodder ?","files":null}]}
