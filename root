This version has the full optical physiology video added as an acquisition object. The resulting files are about 40 GB bigger than the original versions, which is why I'd like them both to be available on the archive.\n\nRunning `dandi organize`, however, results in this message: `1 out of 2 paths are not unique. We will try adding _obj- based on crc32 of object_id`. \n\nGiven that the acquisition module is typically a very major component of a file, is there any way to have the file names reflect whether it is present, e.g. `+acquisition` (just like there is currently `+behavior`, `+ophys` and `+image`)? In my case, this would make interpreting the files versions in my dandiset much more straightforward than the more arbitrary object_id-related identifier.","files":null}]}
