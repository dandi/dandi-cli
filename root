I would like to use the CLI to download just that asset and store it on my filesystem either in the current directory or in the appropriate BIDS-like subdirectories `000011/sub-255201/sub-255201_ses-20141124_behavior+ecephys+ogen.nwb`. How do I do that?\n\nCurrently I find that file on the web UI (or using python functions) to get the asset ID, but at that point, I might as well click the Download button.\n\nI would like one of these or similar to work:\n```\ndandi download DANDI:000011/sub-255201/sub-255201_ses-20141124_behavior+ecephys+ogen.nwb\ndandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000011/0.220126.1907/files?location=sub-255201/sub-255201_ses-20141124_behavior+ecephys+ogen.nwb\n```\n\nRelated to #1075","files":null}]}
