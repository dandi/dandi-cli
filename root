This is valid in NWB. Our recommended best practice is to use ISO 8601 duration format, but that is not a requirement. DANDI failed with a message \"failed to...\". After some digging it became clear the message was \"failed to extract metadata\" and that age was the culprit. This was really bad user experience. She has been trying to upload this data for weeks, spending hours of her time on debugging and was clearly exasperated at this point. Even with me remote controlling into her computer it took 40 minutes to sort all of this out. In the end, she'll need to remove the age field and run her conversions again, which creates the same result as if dandi had simply ignored age values it cannot parse to begin with. That would be my preferred behavior: to permit upload and simply not extract age metadata if it cannot be parsed.\n\nWe have had several conversations with the NWB team about how best to handle cases like this in the standard when the exact age is not known. I think ultimately it might be useful to have lower_bound and upper_bound as optional attributes of the age dataset, both of which, if included, must be ISO 8601, so that age ranges can be parsed by DANDI. Until then, would it be possible to be a little more relaxed about age metadata?","files":null}]}
