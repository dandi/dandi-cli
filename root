This works well in general, but means that adding other specifiers to help identify files can be a bit tricky. For example, the Allen Institute has an experiment id associated with each plane of ophys sessions that is difficult to add to filepaths due to not being a recognized key value pair.\nI am not fully informed about the standards dandi follows for file naming conventions, but I feel that allowing users to include custom key value pairs in their file names would be a useful addition if it does not cause any conflicts with the standards dandi follows.","files":null}]}
