I did not dare to  suggest yet to datalad folks since some agreement was reached at some point to \"not bother\", so would be nice to start here, gain some experience and then \"transfer\" to other projects if seem beneficial.\n\nWe should look into automating\n- changelog composition\n- release to pypi:\n   - conda-forge will pick up by itself and send a PR, alternatively/ideally in the long run -- we could of cause mint a PR, wait for it to finish and report back if all green and when we merge here, merge also that PR against conda-forge -- full automation!!!\n- later: \n  - release for debian as: build source package (so I could download, re-review, sign locally and upload to debian proper) + backports for neurodebian (probably can just automate)\n  - anything else?","files":null}]}
