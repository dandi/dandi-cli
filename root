But what would be the most efficient way to query pypi for list of version current `dandi` (and `dandi-schema`) supports? alternative would be to host somewhere that information here, or just parse e.g. like\n\n```shell\ncurl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandi/dandi-cli/refs/heads/master/setup.cfg | sed -n -e '/python_requires/s,.*\u003e=,,p'\n```\nwith some local caching to do that only once a week or so.","files":null}]}
