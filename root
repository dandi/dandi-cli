I do not think it is network bottlnecked really, and neither it seems to be CPU bound.\n\nWith all the multiple upload urls we should be able to handle blocks (including digests per block) in parallel with benefit even if simply using threads. With original girder based upload I think there were no way to parallelize individual file upload, so we resorted to parallization across files.  I think we might reconsider that (although it would still benefit initial digestion and validation) or just compliment with parallelization within file (across parts) upload.","files":null}]}
