For that, the assets should first be\n  organized using the `dandi organize` command.\n\n  By default all .nwb files in the Dandiset (excluding directories starting\n  with a period) will be considered for the upload.  You can point to specific\n  files you would like to validate and have uploaded.\n\nOptions:\n  -e, --existing [error|skip|force|overwrite|refresh]\n                                  What to do if a file found existing on the\n                                  server.
