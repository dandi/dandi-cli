I think we should always add a record to the log file which would disclose the version of the dandi-cli.  \nIdeally it should also state versions of hdmf, pynwb, and h5py.  Although for some commands (e.g. `download`) they would not even be used, I think it would still be useful even if would require their import right at the beginning of the execution: alternatively, it could be a log message at the end of the log and those versions reported only if were already imported (thus in `sys.modules`).  Somewhat relates to #57, since if `wtf` would produce already relevant record, it would be just a matter of logging it.","files":null}]}
