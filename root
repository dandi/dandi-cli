Is there a way in the dandi-cli to pull only files containing a certain string?  If I run `dandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000409/draft` that pulls way too much for my storage space to handle so I need to cut it down a bit.  I could start with some specific folders as well and just use a bash script with wget, but I was wondering if the dandi-cli has som functionality that I could take advantage of.","files":null}]}
