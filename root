The reason I would like to do this is that I'd like to put the ephys data online first, and then perform spike sorting by streaming that data down into the sorting process. I don't want to then add the result to the original file, because then I'd need to re-upload the new file, which could be very large. Another reason for using a separate file is that I might want to do this more than once, for different sorting algorithms.\n\nSo I'm going to run into a naming problem, because the auto-assigned name is going to be the same (it's based on the session, etc). In that case, I realize that a checksum string will be added to the filename to distinguish it. But that's still not ideal because the name will not indicate which one has the spike sorting result. Ideally the name would have a helpful string in it such as \"sorting\" or \"kilosort\".\n\nWondering what you would recommend. Should I create my own naming convention and figure out how to upload while bypassing the \"organize\" step?\n\nThanks in advance!","files":null}]}
