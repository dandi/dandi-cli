Ideally we should contain that information in the metadata record. I was thinking about `wasGeneratedBy` but I am not sure if that one is actually appropriate since we are to restore namespace names and versions, and not necessarily tools (we don't know for sure) which produced them.\n\nAs for name spaces, for a sample https://github.com/dandi/dandi-api-datasets/blob/master/000045/sub-00778394-c956-408d-8a6c-ca3b05a611d5/sub-00778394-c956-408d-8a6c-ca3b05a611d5_ses-00594aec-bb70-4601-862d-63a31ef0e1c0_behavior%2Bimage.nwb.yaml#L25 for we have\n\n```\n$\u003e ../tools/hdmf-get-namespaces.py /mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000045/sub-00778394-c956-408d-8a6c-ca3b05a611d5/sub-00778394-c956-408d-8a6c-ca3b05a611d5_ses-00594aec-bb70-4601-862d-63a31ef0e1c0_behavior+image.nwb\nExtracting spaces... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00\n\nSummary:\n  Files: 1\n  Counts: \n    core: {'2.2.5': 1}\n    hdmf-common: {'1.2.0': 1}\n    ndx-ibl-metadata: {'0.1.0': 1}\n    ndx-spectrum: {'0.2.2': 1}\n```\n\nAlso sooner or later I expect us to extract more of NWB metadata beyond what we already harmonize.  It would be useful for search, analysis etc, but I do not think it is feasible to harmonize it beyond what nwb-schema provides.  And aforementioned extensions names/versions are more of relevance/interest to dandi-cli than anything (although could already help developers of those extensions to possibly find dandisets which used them -- accountability).\n\nWDYT @satra ?","files":null}]}
