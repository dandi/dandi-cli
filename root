The client should instead optimize for the common case (a Zarr being reuploaded after some local modifications) by modifying the Zarr asset already on the server, only uploading new \u0026 changed Zarr entries and deleting any old ones.\n\nCC @dchiquito: Just to confirm, this is a reasonable thing to implement, right?  Can a Zarr object be modified after it's made into an asset, and does the server correctly handle modification of Zarr data that multiple assets point to?","files":null}]}
