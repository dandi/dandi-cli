As now we do have Datalad datasets for (some/most) of zarr folders, we better add exclusion of `.git`, `.datalad`, .dotdirs etc folders there as we do in `find_files`.  Ideally RF should then include RFing of `find_files` to use threaded_walk with those added exclusion features so we gain speed up in places where we use `find_files`","files":null}]}
