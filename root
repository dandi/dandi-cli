Similar to us they start from non-json-schema/shacl (we use pydantic, they have their own templating) but then convert (to json-schema, shacl etc).\n\nhttps://github.com/HumanBrainProject/kg-editor (might be) the editor for knowledge graph which uses openminds schema.\n\nI wonder if there is anything their model has we don't or vise versa, and if anything to re-use (eg editor etc)\n\nattn @satra who I bet knows more, and @bendichter who is also listening to the presentation ATM ;)","files":null}]}
