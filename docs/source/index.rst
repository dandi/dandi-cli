Welcome to the lincbrain documentation
======================================

The `lincbrain <https://github.com/lincbrain/linc-cli>`_ library provides both a
command line interface (CLI) and a Python API for interacting with `LINC Data
Platform <https://lincbrain.org>`_.

The `lincbrain` CLI tool is a fork of the `dandi` CLI tool -- https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli thus, there are a
handful of references to `dandi` and `Dandisets` throughout these docs. Nevertheless, these docs (and the subsequent
instructions alongside), should be reflected as accurate.
