``dandi.consts``
================

.. automodule:: dandi.consts

    .. NOTE: Due to <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1063>, only
       data values with doc comments are included by automodule::, even with
       `undoc-members` set, and the available workarounds involve explicitly
       listing every data value, leading to problems when the list is not kept
       in sync.
