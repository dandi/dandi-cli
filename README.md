The [DANDI Python client](https://pypi.org/project/dandi/) allows you to:

* Download `Dandisets` and individual subject folders or files
* Validate data to locally conform to standards
* Organize your data locally before upload
* Upload `Dandisets`
* Interact with the DANDI instance's web API from Python
* Delete data in the DANDI instance
* Perform other auxiliary operations with data on the DANDI instance

**Note**: This project is under active development. See [the issues log](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/issues) or
[Work-in-Progress (WiP)](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-cli/pulls).
