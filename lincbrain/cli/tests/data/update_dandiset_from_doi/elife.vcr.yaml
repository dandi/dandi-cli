        the sense of body position, movement, and associated forces, remains poorly
        understood, despite its critical role in movement. Most studies of area 2,
        a proprioceptive area of somatosensory cortex, have simply compared neurons\u2019
        activities to the movement of the hand through space. Using motion tracking,
        we sought to elaborate this relationship by characterizing how area 2 activity
        relates to whole arm movements. We found that a whole-arm model, unlike classic
        models, successfully predicted how features of neural activity changed as
        monkeys reached to targets in two workspaces. However, when we then evaluated
        this whole-arm model across active and passive movements, we found that many
        neurons did not consistently represent the whole arm over both conditions.
        These results suggest that 1) neural activity in area 2 includes representation
        of the whole arm during reaching and 2) many of these neurons represented
        limb state differently during active and passive movements.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7554\/elife.48198","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,23]],"date-time":"2020-01-23T11:00:19Z","timestamp":1579777219000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":37,"title":"Area
