class IteratorWithAggregation:
    """
    An iterable over an iterable which also makes an aggregate of the values available asap

    It iterates over the iterable in a separate thread.

    A use case is a generator which collects information about resources,
    which might be relatively fast but still take time.  While we are iterating over it,
    we could perform other operations on yielded records, but we would also like to have access to
    the "summary" object as soon as that iterator completes but while we might still be
    iterating over items in the outside loop.

    Use case: iterate over remote resource for downloads, and get "Total" size/number as
    soon as it becomes known inside the underlying iterator.

    TODO: probably could be more elegant etc if implemented via async/coroutines.

    Attributes
    ----------
    .total:
      Aggregated value as known to the moment. None if nothing was aggregated.
      It is a final value if `finished` is True.
    .finished: bool
      Set to True upon completion of iteration
    .exc: BaseException or None
      If not None -- the exception which was raised

    Example
    -------

    Very simplistic example, since typically (not range) it would be taking some time to
    iterate for the nested iteration::

        it = IteratorWithAggregation(range(3), lambda v, t=0: v+t)
        for v in it:
            print(it.total, it.finished, v)
            sleep(0.02)  # doing smth heavy, but we would know .total as soon as it is known

    would produce (so 3 is known right away, again since it is just range)

        3 True 0
        3 True 1
        3 True 2

        Parameters
        ----------
        gen: iterable
          Generator (but could be any iterable, but it would not make much sense)
          to yield from
        agg: callable
          A callable with two args: new_value[, total=None] which should return adjusted
          total. Upon first iteration, no prior `total` is provided
        reraise_immediately: bool, optional
          If True, it would stop yielding values as soon as it detects that some
          exception has occurred (although there might still be values in the queue to be yielded
          which were collected before the exception was raised)
