.. versionadded:: 0.36.0

`dandi.files` defines functionality for working with local files & directories
(as opposed to remote resources on a DANDI Archive server) that are of interest
to DANDI.  The classes for such files & directories all inherit from
`DandiFile`, which has two immediate subclasses: `DandisetMetadataFile`, for
representing :file:`dandiset.yaml` files, and `LocalAsset`, for representing
files that can be uploaded as assets to DANDI Archive.
